           CRL. A. No. 1175 of 2009
                                                    1



                                                                                 REPORTABLE
                                 IN THE SUPREME COURT OF INDIA
                                CRIMINAL APPELLATE JURISDICTION

                           CRIMINAL APPEAL NO.            1175       OF 2009


                 MAHESH                                              .....           APPELLANT

                                                VERSUS

                 STATE OF DELHI                                      .....           RESPONDENT


                                             O R D E R



            1.       Three persons Mahavir, Jalvir, Mahesh were

            brought        to    trial    for    offences        punishable      under

            
Sections        394
/
302
/
34
       IPC        for    an    incident        that

            happened in the residential house of Seema Sharma


            -P.W. 4., the first informant at about 4:15p.m. on

            the 24th February, 1997. A fourth person, Roopa also

            involved       in     the    incident       died   during    the    trial.

            The trial court on a consideration of the evidence

            convicted the three accused and sentenced each of

            them    to     undergo       imprisonment          for    life     for    the

            offence under 
Section 302
 IPC and to a sentence of

            10 years for the offence under 
Section 394
 of the

            IPC, both the sentences to run concurrently.                         Three

            appeals thereafter were filed before the Delhi High

            Court which, by its judgment dated 08th March, 2007,

            dismissed the appeals.               Jalvir, one of the accused

            thereupon filed Criminal Appeal No. 1475 of 2007

CRL. A. No. 1175 of 2009


                                                   2




            which came up before this Court on 11th April, 2008.

            A Bench of this Court held that the only witness of

            the incident was P.W. 4 Seema Sharma who claimed

            and she knew Jalvir personally and having held as

            above    dismissed        the    appeal.      Mahavir      also    filed

            Criminal       Appeal      No.   932   of    2007    in   this    Court.

            This appeal was allowed with the positive finding

            that Seema Sharma - P.W. 4 had not been able to

            identify       the    accused     as   she    was    unaware     of    his

            identify and as the police had shown the accused to

            the     witness       which      justified     their      refusal       to

            participate          in   the    identification       parade     and    as

            such    the    only       evidence     against      Mahavir    was     the

            identification by P.W. 4, Seema Sharma in Court and

            as this identification was a weak kind of evidence

            Mahavir       was    entitled     to   acquittal.         Mahesh,      the

            third accused has subsequently filed the present

            appeal in this Court claiming parity with the facts

            in Mahavir's case.



            2.       We     have taken up this matter for hearing

            today and have heard the learned counsel for the

            parties and perused the documents on record. We see

            from the record that the role attributed to Mahesh

            and the evidence against him is identical with that

            of Mahavir who haS already been acquitted by this

CRL. A. No. 1175 of 2009


                                                    3




            Court.         We    called      upon       Mr.    P.P.   Malhotra,       the

            learned Additional Solicitor General to tell us if

            there    was     any      difference         in    the    nature    of    the

            evidence with respect to the case of Mahesh and

            Mahavir.        The       learned      Additional         Solicitor      very

            fairly stated that it was not possible to identify

            any difference with respect to the evidence against

            Mahavir and Mahesh.                  We are thus of the view that

            Mahesh    too       is    entitled       to       acquittal.        We    are

            informed by the learned counsel for the appellant

            that     he    has       undergone       about      13    years    of     the

            sentence.       It is indeed a travesty of justice that

            a    person    who       has    almost       completed     the     sentence

            should get an acquittal after such a delay.                             There

            is, therefore, little satisfaction for him but a

            sad commentary on our criminal justice system.


            3.       The    appeal         is,   accordingly,         allowed.        The

            appellant       is     acquitted        of    the    charges       levelled

            against him.           He is directed to be set at liberty

            if not required in connection with any other case.

                    We have heard the learned counsel for the

            parties.



                    Vide        our    separate    reasoned      order,    we    have

            allowed this appeal. It is stated by the learned

            counsel for the appellant that he is in custody and

            has almost undergone the complete sentence imposed

            for   murder.             The   appellant    is    acquitted    of    the

            charges levelled against him.                     We direct that the

            appellant shall be set at liberty forthwith if not

            required       in    connection       with    any   other     case.


                    The reasoned order is separately placed on

            record.
