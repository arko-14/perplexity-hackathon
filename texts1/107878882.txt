Bench: 
R.M. Lodha
, 
Harjit Singh Bedi


           Crl. App. No. 715 of 2010 @ SLP(Crl.) 7197 of 2008
                                                                   1




                                         IN THE SUPREME COURT OF INDIA
                                        CRIMINAL APPELLATE JURISDICTION

                                 CRIMINAL APPEAL NO. 715 OF 2010
                            [arising out of SLP(CRL.) No. 7197 of 2008]



          GOBARDHAN PANDIT                                                .....                  APPELLANT



                                                                 VERSUS

          STATE OF BIHAR & ANR.                                           .....              RESPONDENTS




                                                             O R D E R



         1.           Leave granted.





         2.           This         appeal            has    been       filed    by   the    husband

         impugning the judgment of the High Court of Judicature

         at       Patna          dated         14th        August,      2008,     whereby        while

         noticing that the wife                            had re-married has nevertheless

         rejected the application of the husband, calling upon

         the Court to set aside the order of maintenance ordered

         by the courts below under 
Section 125
 of the Code of

         Criminal             Procedure.                   The    learned      counsel     for    the

         appellant has argued that in the light of the documents
Crl. App. No. 715 of 2010 @ SLP(Crl.) 7197 of 2008

                                                                     2




         and record which have been referred to in the paper

         book,         it      was      clear          that    subsequent         to   the    divorce

         obtained             by       the           appellant-husband,           the       wife    had

         remarried and had also borne a child from the second

         husband.              The learned counsel for the respondent-wife

         has, however, submitted that there was no evidence to

         suggest that such marriage had indeed taken place or

         that a child had been born out of the second marriage.




         3.           We      notice          from       the     impugned        order      that    the

         question of the wife's marriage had indeed been raised

         before the High Court for the first time but had been

         rejected            on      the      ground          that       there   was   no    evidence

         placed to show the factum of the second marriage or

         otherwise.               We are, however, of the opinion that in the

         light of the documents that have come on record and in

         the light of the provisions of 
Section 125
 Cr.P.C., it

         would be appropriate that the factum of the second

         marriage             be examined              after the leading of evidence as

         the maintenance under 
Section 125
 Cr.P.C. would depend

         on the             factum of the second                         marriage       as also the

         fact as to whether the child that                                  has allegedly          been

         born        to      the       respondent-wife                    was     in    or    outside

         wedlock.             We, accordingly, allow this appeal, set aside

         the impugned order and remit the case to the trial
Crl. App. No. 715 of 2010 @ SLP(Crl.) 7197 of 2008

                                                               3




         court for decision                          afresh in accordance with law.        The

         parties              would            be      entitled    to   lead    evidence    in

         support of their respective cases and we request the

         trial court to take a quick decision in the matter as

         it has been pending since long.                           We also clarify that

         any remarks made in this judgment would not be taken as

         a reflection on the merits of the case.                               As an interim

         arrangement,                more        particularly,     keeping     in   view   the

         explanation under 
Section 125(1)
 of the Cr.P.C., we

         direct that till the trial court takes a decision in

         the matter,                the maintenance that is being paid to the

         respondent-wife would be continued to be paid.




         4.           The appeal is allowed in the aforesaid terms.

         Parties shall appear before the trial court on 11th

         August, 2010.                  There would be no order as to costs.
