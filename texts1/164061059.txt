           Crl.A. 395 of 2005
                                                     1




                                IN THE SUPREME COURT OF INDIA
                              CRIMINAL APPELLATE JURISDICTION

                            CRIMINAL APPEAL NO.             395    OF 2005




                K.V. CHACKO                                               .....           APPELLANT

                                                VERSUS

               STATE OF KERALA                                           .....            RESPONDENT




                                               O R D E R



         1.          The High Court had decided several issues in this

         matter but had primarily declined to grant leave to the

         appellant on the ground that as the three sentences imposed

         on the appellant had not been remitted or commuted by the

         State Government any relief under Section 427 or 428 of the

         
Code of Criminal Procedure
 would be academic at this stage.

         We     also    notice   that    in    the       three    cases    in     which    the

         appellant had been convicted for murder, the three special

         leave       petitions   had    been    filed      in     this    Court    had    been

         dismissed in limine.





         2.          The learned counsel for the appellant has, however,

         pointed out that in the light of the specific provisions of

         
Sections 422
 and 
428
 of Cr.P.C., the directions of the

         Sessions Judge that the sentences imposed for the three
Crl.A. 395 of 2005

                                                      2




         murders would run to life and in case they were remitted or

         commuted they would thereafter run consecutively, was not

         called for.



         3.          The learned counsel for the respondent-State has,

         however, pointed out that as the appeals in the criminal

         matters had attained finality up to this Court, it would be

         improper for this Court to interfere.                    Be that as it may,

         we are not inclined to grant leave to the appellant at this

         stage        for    the    simple        reason   that   no   commutation     or

         remission in the sentence has so far been ordered by the

         State Government.            However, in the light of the issues that

         have        been    raised    by    the    appellant,    we   direct    in    the

         interest of justice, that in case the State Government

         passes orders in the aforesaid terms, the appellant would

         be at liberty to approach the High Court yet again and the

         High        Court   would     consider      the   application    de    hors   the

         impugned order and on its own merit.



         4.          The     fees     of    the     learned   Amicus     is    fixed    at

         Rs.7,000/-.
