Rama Rani & Ors vs State Of M.P.& Anr on 22 April, 2010


Bench: 
J.M. Panchal
, 
Harjit Singh Bedi


                                IN THE SUPREME COURT OF INDIA
                    CRIMINAL APPELLATE JURISDICTION

                    CRIMINAL APPEAL NO. 865 OF 2010
                             ARISING OUT OF
          SPECIAL LEAVE PETITION (CRIMINAL) NO. 6360 OF 2009


RAMA RANI & ORS.                              .....           APPELLANTS



                                   VERSUS

STATE OF M.P. & ANR.                          ....            RESPONDENTS


                                  O R D E R



    1.     Leave granted.



    2.     This appeal arises out of the order dated 24th

    April, 2009 passed by the learned Single Judge of the

    High Court of Madhya Pradesh whereby an application

    under 
Section 482
 of the Code of Criminal Procedure

    filed by the appellants herein had been rejected solely

    on the ground that the evidence before the trial court

    had already been completed with the result that the

    quashing at this late stage was not called for.


    3.     Mr. Shakeel Ahmed Syed, the learned counsel for

    the appellants herein has also filed some additional

    documents including the order sheet up to 12th May,

    2009 which reveals that in fact no statements have so

    far   been   recorded.   He   further     states   that    even

    thereafter no statements had been recorded because the

    respondents have been getting the case adjourned on the
 plea that some matters were pending either in the High

 Court or in the Supreme Court.



 4.    In this view of the matter and in the light of

 the fact that an error has apparently been committed by

 the learned Single Judge in the impugned order, we set

 aside the order aforesaid and remit the case to the

 High Court for decision afresh.



 5.      We must also observe that this matter had been

 referred to the Mediation Cell of this Court to see if

 any settlement could be arrived at. A report from the

 Cell dated 25th March, 2010 has been received which is

 in the negative.



 6.    We further make it clear that any observation

 hereinabove would not affect the decision of the High

 Court either ways.



 7.    The appeal stands disposed of in the aforesaid

 terms. Parties shall appear before the High Court on

 17th August, 2010.
