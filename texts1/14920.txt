                            IN THE SUPREME COURT OF INDIA
                 CIVIL     APPELLATE JURISDICTION


             CIVIL APPEAL NOS. 3544-3545 OF            2010
        (Arising out of SLP(C) Nos.28100-28101/2008)




KU. KUNDA MOTIRAM BODALKAR                              Appellant(s)


                         :VERSUS:


SWAMI VIVEKANAND SHIKSHAN SANSTHA & ORS.                Respondent(s)




                              O R D E R



        Delay condoned.



        Leave granted.



        Heard counsel for the appellant and the contesting

respondent     no.4.   Also     heard     counsel   representing       the

State   of    Maharashtra.      Counsel    appearing   on     behalf   of

respondent No.6 is supporting the claim of the appellant.




        The    dispute     in     this     case     relates     to     the

appointment of the Headmistress of Sant Shivram Maharaj

Madhyamik     Vidyalaya,      Bhandara,     which    is a     recognized

                                         -2-




secondary       school       run        by     Swami      Vivekanand       Shikshan

Sanstha, respondent no.1. The appellant was appointed as

Headmistress of the school by respondent No.6 in the year

2004.     Admittedly, prior permission for her appointment

was not obtained from the competent authority and that

alone is the reason for which the High Court found the

appointment illegal and struck it down.




        It    is     undeniable          that       the    appointment         of   the

appellant as the Headmistress was made on the basis of an

advertisement. It is also clear that at that time no

other teacher in the school was eligible to be appointed

as Headmistress. It is also not denied that later on the

appellant's        appointment          was       approved   by    the    competent

authority.      We were also told that since her appointment

the    appellant      is    working          as    the    Headmistress         in   the

school.



        Learned counsel appearing for the State admitted

that    apart      from     the        fact       that    there    was    no    prior

permission      for        the     appointment,           there     is    no    other

irregularity          in         the     appellant's             appointment         as

Headmistress.



        In those facts, we are of the view that the High

court   was     in   error        in    interfering         in    the    matter     and

setting aside the appellant's appointment.

                         -3-


      We, accordingly, set aside the High Court order

and confirm the appellant's appointment to the post of

Headmistress.



      The appeals stand allowed accordingly.
