                                      O R D E R



      1.      We    have    heard   the   learned    counsel   for    the

      parties at very great length.





      2.      There are two sets of agreements to sell both
CA Nos. 1209-1210 of 2003

                                                      2




      dated    2/11/1983          interse      Vijaya          Shrivastava        and     M/s

      Mirahul Enterprises and the second between Admiral R.R.

      Sood & M/s. Mirahul Enterprises.                              Vijaya Shrivastava

      and Admiral R.R. Sood are the plaintiffs in the suits

      whereas     Mirahul         Enterprises             -     respondent        is      the

      builder.         The respondent has attempted to challenge

      the   validity        of    these     two      agreements.           The    Division

      Bench of the High Court in its impugned judgments dated

      14.07.2008           has    held    that       the       agreements        had     been

      executed and that the price of Rs. 2,64,000/- fixed for

      each of the two flats was indeed the correct price.                                 On

      the contrary, the Single Bench, which is the trial

      court in this case, has given a positive finding that

      the agreements also dated 2/11/1983 which fixed the

      sale price at Rs. 2,64,261/- plus Rs. 1,71,000 in both

      the cases were in fact which needed to be specifically

      enforced.       Be that as it may, in order to balance the

      equities between the parties and on account of the

      number     of    years       that     have          gone      by,    we     deem    it

      appropriate          that    though      the        Division        Bench    in     its

      judgment       had    recorded       a    positive            finding      that     the

      amount    to    be     paid    for       each       of     the   flats      was    Rs.

      2,64,261       yet    as    the     execution            of    second      agreement

      fixing a higher price has not been denied by the flat

      owner applicants, it would balance the equities if the
CA Nos. 1209-1210 of 2003

                                                3




      aforesaid plaintiff-appellants are called upon to pay

      some   extra    amount     to    the   respondent.       We   are   also

      informed that a sum of Rs. 9 lakhs lies deposited in

      respect of both the properties in this Court under the

      interim     orders       dated    07th     February,    2003.        We,

      accordingly, feel that the interests of justice would

      be met if a sum of Rs. 4 lakhs i.e. 2 lakhs each to be

      apportioned between the two plaintiffs is deducted and

      paid to the respondent i.e. M/s. Mirahul enterprises

      and that the balance amount deposited in this Court be

      returned to the plaintiffs forthwith.                  We also direct

      that the sale consideration that has been deposited by

      M/s Mirahul Enterpirses in this Court or in the High

      Court shall be refunded to them forthwith.                The appeals

      are disposed of in the above terms.





      3.      Mr. A.T.M. Sampath the learned counsel appearing

      for Mohd. Arshad, the appellant in Civil Appeal No.

      3397 of 2010 arising out of SLP(C) No. 11430 of 2010

      who claims to be a purchaser for value without notice

      has also made a claim to the property claimed by Vijaya

      Shrivastava.          In the light of what we have held above

      endorsing the view of the Single Judge and the Division

      Bench of the High Court,                 Mohd. Arshad has no claim

      against the plaintiff Vijaya Shrivastava.                Mohd. Arshad
CA Nos. 1209-1210 of 2003

                                         4




      may, accordingly, pursue such other remedies which are

      available to him with respect to the respondent Mirahul

      Enterprises or any other party.





      4.      We   further   direct   that   the   respondent-builder

      will execute the sale deed in favour of the plaintiffs

      within a period of four months from today.
