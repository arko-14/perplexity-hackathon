Bench: 
Surinder Singh Nijjar
, 
B. Sudershan Reddy


                            IN THE SUPREME COURT OF INDIA
                 CIVIL APPELLATE JURISDICTION

                 CIVIL APPEAL NO. 7278 OF 2002


YASHWANT SHAH (D) BY LRS.              .....      APPELLANTS

                            VERSUS


 PREETI AGGARWAL & ANR.                .....      RESPONDENTS


                           O R D E R



         Having heard the learned counsel for the parties at

length, we find no error to have been committed by the

Special Court in granting decree in Summons for Judgment

No. 1 of 1999.     No question of law as such arises for our

consideration.     However, having regard to the totality of

the facts and circumstances of the case, we consider it

appropriate to reduce the rate of interest from that of

18% per annum as awarded by the Special Court to 9% per

annum.



         The appeal succeeds to this limited extent.        The

appeal is partly allowed without any order as to costs.

                                  [B. SUDERSHAN REDDY]
