SAROJA                                                                  Appellant (s)

                   VERSUS

STATE TR.INSP.OF POLICE                                                 Respondent(s)




                                      O R D E R



                       These    applications, being CRLMP.NO. 21374 &

          21375/2009,          have       been   filed      on    behalf    of   the

          appellant            in     a      disposed       of      matter,      for

          clarification/modification of the order dated 10th

          August,, 2009, by which                     Crl.A. No.1480 of 2009

          had    been     disposed         of.    In    our      said   order,    the

          sentence had been reduced from two years to the

          minimum punishment of six months under 
Section 7
 of

          the Prevention of Corruption Act, 1988, and from

          three years to the minimum punishment of one year

          under 
Section 13(1)(d)
 and 
13(2)
 of the aforesaid

          Act.    While passing the said order, it appears that

          we     had     not    mentioned        as    to     whether     the    said

          sentences            were        to    run        consecutively         or
          concurrently, although, the trial court had done

          so.





                                  -2-    Crl.A.1480/09


                   We,   therefore,   clarify   our   order   to   the

          extent that the two sentences in respect of the two

          offences shall run concurrently.


                The applications are disposed of, accordingly.
