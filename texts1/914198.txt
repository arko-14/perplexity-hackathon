Supreme Court of India


Commnr. Of Central Excise, Mumbai vs M/S. Tikitar Industries & Anr on 22 April, 2010


Bench: 
T.S. Thakur
, 
D.K. Jain


                                  IN THE SUPREME COURT OF INDIA
                       CIVIL APPELLATE JURISDICTION


                   CIVIL APPEAL NOs. 2566-2569 OF 2003



Commnr. of Central Excise, Mumbai                      ..         Appellant(s)

                                       Versus

M/s. Tikitar Industries & Anr.                         ..         Respondent(s)


                                    O R D E R



       In    these        appeals     under     
Section      35-L(b)
    of     the

Central     Excise    Act,    1944,     (for       short,   "the    Act"),     the

following       two questions have been framed                   by the revenue

for adjudication :



                  (i)   Whether  the   conversion  of
            `Straight Grade Bitumen' not `Blown Grade
            Bitumen' amounts to manufacture or not;

            and


                  (ii)    Whether `Roof                   Felt'   is
            classifiable under Chapter                   sub-heading
            5903.90 or 5907.90 ?



       Since       admittedly       answer    to    both    the    afore-noted,

questions stands concluded by the decisions of this Court,

we deem it unnecessary to state the facts giving rise to

these appeals.





       Insofar       as     the     first     question      is    concerned,     a

similar issue came up for consideration before this Court

in   the    case     of the       present assessee in Commissioner of
                                                                    ..2/-





                                  : 2 :


Central Excise and Customs vs. Tikatar Industries
, 2006

(202) E.L.T. 215 (S.C.).         Relying on the circular issued by

the Board on 1st July, 1988,         it was held that the process

of converting straight grade              bitumen into blown grade

bitumen through Oxidation, known as blowing process, does

not amount to manufacture and therefore, exempted                   from

payment     of Excise duty.       Thus, while observing that the

Revenue cannot be permitted to take a stand contrary to its

own stand in the said circular, the view taken by the

Customs, Excise and Gold (Control) Appellate              Tribunal (for

short, "the Tribunal" was affirmed.


       Similarly, the second issue was considered by this

Court in C.C.E., Navi Mumbai vs. Amar Bitumen & Allied

Products Pvt. Ltd., 2006 (202) E.L.T. 213 (S.C.) and it was

held      that   `Bitumenised       Hessian       based     felt'    was

classifiable     under     Chapter     Heading      59.09     and    the

assessee would be entitled to exemption from payment of

excise duty under Notification Nos. 53/65-C.E. and 92/94-

C.E.   dated     20th    March    1965,     and    25th   April,     1994

respectively.

                                                             ..3/-





                               : 3 :


         In the light of the opinion expressed by this Court

in the said pronouncements, with which we are in respectful

agreement, we affirm the findings recorded by the Tribunal

and answer both the questions in favour of the assessee and

against the Revenue.        The appeals, being devoid of any

merit,    are   dismissed   accordingly.     The   parties   shall,

however, bear their own costs.
