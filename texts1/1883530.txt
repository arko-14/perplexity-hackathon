                 With Civil Appeal No.6225 of 2004


                            O     R    D   E     R


Civil Appeal No.2771 of 2002:



        Heard learned counsel for the parties to the lis.
        In   our   opinion,     keeping          in    view    the    facts   and
circumstances of the case, we need not have to interfere with
the   impugned   order   passed       by   the       High   Court    of   Calcutta
(Circuit Bench at Port Blair).                 Accordingly, we reject the
civil appeal.

        However, the question of law raised by the appellants
in this appeal is kept open to be urged and argued in an
appropriate case.

        No order as to costs.



Civil Appeal No.6225 of 2004:



        Heard learned counsel for the parties to the lis.
        This appeal arises out of the order passed by the
High Court of Calcutta (Circuit Bench at Port Blair) in C.R.
No.14 of 2002 dated 19th September, 2002.

                                                                           ....2/-

                                  - 2 -

       By     the   impugned    order,     the    High     Court    has    only
directed the petitioner therein, if it so desires, to file an
appropriate    application       under    
Section     18
     of    the     Land
Acquisition Act, 1894.       The High Court gave a week's time to
the petitioner therein to prefer such an application before
the Reference Court.

       Aggrieved by the orders passed by the High Court of
Calcutta in C.R. No.14 of 2002, the appellant is before us in
this appeal.

       There    was    a   connected     appeal    bearing    Civil      Appeal
No.2771 of 2002.       In that appeal we have taken a view that
the lands in question are no more agricultural lands, but
non-agricultural lands.

       It is now for the appellant to make an appropriate
application before the Reference Court for fixing the higher
rate of compensation in view of the fact that the lands in
question are the non-agricultural lands.             In that view of the
matter, we do not intend to interfere with the order passed
the High Court.

       Accordingly, we dispose of the appeal.                     However, we
grant liberty to the appellant, if it so desires, to make an
appropriate    application     before    the     Reference    Court      within
four weeks from today.         If such an application is filed, the
Reference   Court     will   entertain     the    application       and   pass
appropriate orders after affording opportunity of hearing to
the parties.

       In the facts and circumstances of the case, no order
as to costs.
