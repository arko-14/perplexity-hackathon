THE STATE OF GUJARAT                                Respondent(s)




                            O R D E R



       Leave granted.



       We have heard the learned counsel for the parties.

       Appellants have been convicted under 
Sections 143
,


147
 & 
337
 of the Indian Penal Code and sentenced to

undergo   simple   imprisonment    for   one    month.   Appellant

Nos.1, 3 & 4 have also been convicted and sentenced under


Sections 452
, 
324
 & 
427
 of the Indian Penal Code for a

period of six months simple imprisonment.


       The incident is more than two decades old. It is

submitted that the parties have been peacefully living

together for a long time and the accused persons who have

been   convicted   under   
Sections   143
,   
147
   &   
337
   of   the

I.P.C. and sentenced for one month's imprisonment have

already undergone imprisonment for 27 days.

                                -2-


       On a consideration of the totality of the facts

and circumstances of this case, particularly the nature

of injuries and the proximate relationship amongst the

parties, we are of the opinion that ends of justice would

be   met   if,   while    maintaining    the   conviction     of    the

accused under 
Sections 143
, 
147
 & 
337
 of the I.P.C.,

their sentence is reduced to the period already undergone

by them. We direct accordingly.



       Appellant Nos.1, 3 and 4 who have been convicted

under 
Sections 452
, 
324
 and 
427
 of the I.P.C., their

sentence is reduced from six months to two months.




       The impugned order passed by the High Court is

modified    to   the     aforesaid    extent   and   the   appeal    is

disposed of accordingly.
