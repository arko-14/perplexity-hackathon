Supreme Court of India


Animesh Ranjan & Ors vs Rai Chandi Nath Sahay & Anr on 8 April, 2010


Bench: 
J.M. Panchal
, 
Harjit Singh Bedi


           CA No. 1920 of 2009
                                         1



                          IN THE SUPREME COURT OF INDIA
                           CIVIL APPELLATE JURISDICTION

                           CIVIL APPEAL NO. 1920 OF 2009




     ANIMESH RANJAN & ORS.                       .....          APPELLANT



                                      VERSUS

     RAI CHANDI NATH SAHAY & ANR.                .....      RESPONDENT


                                        WITH
                            CIVIL APPEAL NO.    OF 2010
                      ARISING OUT OF SLP(c) No. 36252 of 2009


                                     O R D E R



       1.      Leave granted in SLP(C) 36252 of 2009.




       2.      We have heard the learned counsel for the parties at

       length.





       3.      In the light of the fact that the appellants herein

       had been granted Probate of the Will dated 3rd January,

       1983 and the rival Will set up by the respondents has been

       ignored, we find no balance of convenience in favour of

       the respondent. Certain legal issues have been raised with

       regard to the right of the appellants to alienate the

       property in contravention of the specific bar imposed by

CA No. 1920 of 2009


                                          2



       the Will but we find that this matter will have to await a

       decision in the suit which is pending before the trial

       court.     However, keeping in view the facts of the case and

       to balance the equities on both sides it is appropriate

       that as the appellants        have not been able to act upon the

       Will for almost 27 years, we direct that the appellants be

       permitted to complete the building in question.




       4.       Mr. Shyam Diwan, the learned senior counsel for the

       appellant, further informs us that 32 flats in all have

       been carved out in the building for sale and whereas 19

       have been agreed to be sold, the balance 13 flats will be

       completed but will not be sold or any agreement to sell

       executed in respect of these till further orders.                  Mr.

       Diwan further states that in case sale deeds are executed

       with respect to those 19 flats a clause in the sale deed

       would    be    incorporated   highlighting   that   the   matter   was

       subjudice and the parties would be bound by the outcome of

       the proceedings in the civil suit.





       5.       In the light of the fact that the matter has been

       pending since long in one forum or the other, we direct

       the trial court to take a decision in the suit within a

       period of six months from today and in case it finds that

       either one or the other party is procrastinating in the

CA No. 1920 of 2009


                                      3



       disposal of the suit the trial court will ensure a speedy

       trial, by resorting to the legal provisions available in

       
the Code of Civil Procedure
.






       CA NO. 3654 of 2010 @ SLP(C) No. 36252 of 2009


       6.      The order of the High Court shall be substituted by

       our order in C.A. No.1920 of 2009.   The matter is disposed

       of accordingly.
