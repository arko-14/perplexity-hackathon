S. CHAUHAN, J. 1. Civil Appeal No. 4421 of 2010 was disposed of by this Court vide judgment and order dated 7.5.2010 giving liberty to the appellants therein to approach the Bombay High Court to seek appropriate relief. During the pendency of the appeal, the appellants were given liberty to approach the District Collector concerned to seek permission to repair the bund. The Collector allowed the appellants to repair the bund subject to certain conditions. The parties in the appeal have filed three applications alleging various violations of the orders passed by this Court, as well as by the District Collector. I.A.No. 23/2010 2. This application has been filed by the District Collector, Mumbai Suburban District, to initiate the contempt proceedings against the appellants Krishnadevi Malchand Kamathia & Ors. for violating the order of this court dated 7.5.2010 in Civil Appeal No.4421 of 2010 and his own order dated 27.1.2010 in respect of Survey No. 344 CTS No. 1 of Village Dahisar, Taluka Borivali, Mumbai Suburban District and, to issue directions to remove the newly constructed bund and allow sea water to come in so as to save the mangrove forest. Further direction has been sought against the appellants to remove the debris, soil, stones which were used to construct the bund, from the said survey No.344 to outside the area, 2 within the stipulated period and further to restore the bund to its original position as seen in the Maharashtra Remote Sensing Application Centre map (hereinafter called MRSAC) and further to restrain the appellants from indulging in any activity which may result in the destruction of mangrove forest henceforth. Cont. Pet. No. 169 of 2010 3. This contempt petition has been filed by the appellants to initiate contempt proceedings against the statutory authorities i.e. District Collector of Mumbai Suburban District for passing the order dated 20.5.2010 appointing the Committee to examine whether the appellants had violated the conditional order dated 27.1.2010 permitting the appellants to repair the bund in such a way that the mangroves may not die and order dated 26.5.2010 to ensure the compliance of the order dated 27.1.2010 and to remove the debris and reduce the height of the bund etc., being in violation of orders passed by this Court in the appeal. Cont. Pet. No. 266 of 2010 4. This contempt petition has been filed by the original writ petitioner before the Bombay High Court i.e. Bombay Environmental 3 Action Group and Anr., (hereinafter called `Action Group') to initiate contempt proceedings against the appellants for willful dis-obedience of the order of this Court dated 22.3.2010 passed in SLP (C) No. 29031/2009 and order dated 7.5.2010 passed in Civil Appeal No.4421 of 2010 and further to recall the permission granted by this Court vide order dated 22.3.2010 in the said case and order dated 7.5.2010 in Civil Appeal No. 4421 of 2010. Further, to give directions to open the culverts, closed channels of water and to ensure removal of debris on the subject site at the cost of the appellants i.e. contemnors Nos. 1 to 10. 5. As all the aforesaid three applications have been filed alleging violation of the same orders, the applications were heard together and all being disposed of by the common order. FACTS: 6. The Bombay High Court while disposing of the Writ Petition filed by the Action Group vide order dated 6.10.2005 issued several directions including: ""XI. From the list of ""Mangrove Areas"" so identified Government owned lands will automatically be declared/notified as ""Protected Forest"". Likewise, 4 privately owned lands from the list of Mangrove Areas so identified, the same will be declared/notified as ""Forest"". 7. In pursuance of the aforesaid direction issued by the High Court, the Divisional Commissioner, issued Notification being No. RB/Desk-II/Forest/CR-2211/Pvt./A-1 dated 18.2.2009, which included the land of the appellants Krishnadevi Malchand Kamathia and Ors. In view of the said Notification, the appellants could not restart the salt manufacturing, though the appellants had been manufacturing salt on the said land since 1959. It continued upto 1990 and their license for manufacturing salt was valid upto 1993. The Coastal Area Classification and Development Regulations, 1991 (hereinafter called CRZ Regulations) came which provide for classification of coastal regulatory zone, according to which it did not prohibit the manufacturing of salt. 8. Being aggrieved, appellants filed Special Leave Petition along with an application for condonation of delay of 1368 days challenging the Bombay High Court Judgment and order dated 6.10.2005. However, in view of the fact that the appellants had not been heard by the High Court at the time of passing the order in pursuance of which 5 the Notification has been issued, the delay was condoned and the petition was entertained. 9. An application was filed by the appellants on 15.12.2009 seeking permission to repair the damaged bund along with the land in issue. The application was opposed by the respondents. However, this Court disposed of the said application vide order dated 5.2.2010 permitting the appellants to approach the District Collector for the said relief. It was clarified that pendency of the proceedings before this Court or any interim order passed therein would not stand in the way of the District Collector to pass an appropriate order so far as the repair of the bund was concerned. 10. In pursuance of the said directions the appellants approached the District Collector, who after holding inquiry passed a speaking and reasoned order dated 27.1.2010 giving full details and the case history of the dispute over the title of the land between the appellants and the Government, and the application of the provisions of Coastal Regulatory Zone Regulations 1991; and the Indian Forest Act 1927; and Forest (Conservation) Act, 1980 . According to the order, the 6 appellants would repair the bund without destroying the mangroves or vegetation on the said land. 11. This Court disposed of the appeal vide order dated 7.5.2010 wherein the parties were given liberty to agitate the issue before the High Court raising all factual and legal issues. So far as the repair of Bund was concerned, this Court directed as under: ""By an interim order passed by this court on 22.3.2010, permitted the petitioners to repair the Bund. This interim order is made absolute and petitioners are permitted to maintain and upkeep the Bund till final adjudication regarding Notifications dated 18.2.2009 and 15.6.2009 is made and violation of these orders by parties or other authorities could be brought to the notice of this Court for appropriate directions."" 12. The contempt petitions have been filed by the District Collector and the Action Group making allegations that under the garb of repairing the bund, the appellants have raised the height and expanded the width of the bund in such a manner that mangrove would die a natural death without any attempt on the part of the appellants, and further that appellants have destroyed the mangroves to the great extent. Appellants filed a Contempt Petition alleging that Collector's 7 order dated 27.1.2010 is being unnecessarily interfered with by the statutory authorities. 13. We have heard Shri Ram Jethmalani, Shri Sekhar Naphade, Shri Dushyant Dave, Shri Atul Yashwant Chitale, learned senior counsel appearing for the parties and perused the record. 14. It may be pertinent to mention here that all the learned counsel appearing for the parties have suggested that the applications be heard without giving strict adherence to the procedure for contempt proceedings i.e. framing of charges etc., as pleadings are complete and parties are fully aware as what is the case against which of the parties. More so, all the documentary evidence, required to decide the case is on record. 15. Shri Ram Jethmalani, learned senior counsel appearing for the appellants, submitted that in pursuance of the order of this Court dated 7.5.2010, the appellants have instituted a civil suit before the Bombay High Court, wherein notices had been issued to the respondents/defendants and which is still pending consideration of all factual and legal issues had been raised therein. The validity of the Notification dated 18.2.2009 is also under challenge therein to the 8 extent that the said Notification is void ab initio for the reason that the procedure prescribed in law has not been followed. More so, the Notification does not disclose what are the statutory provisions which conferred the power/competence to issue the said Notification. 16. Shri Sekhar Naphade, and Shri Dushyant Dave, learned senior counsel, submitted that undoubtedly, the Notification does not disclose the source of power/competence under which it has been issued, however, the Notification does not become invalid merely for want of such a statement. Further, it cannot be urged that the Authority was denude of power to issue such notification as such powers are available under Section 21 of the Maharashtra Private Forest (Acquisition) Act, 1975. The said provisions provide that whenever it appears to the State Government that any tract of land not being the property of Government, contains trees and shrubs, pasture lands and any other land whatsoever, and that it should be declared, in public interest and for furtherance of the objects of the said Act, to be a private forest. The State Government would publish a Notification in the Official Gazette to declare that it was a forest land after following the procedure prescribed therein. In fact records of the Statutory Authority reveal that the said Notification has been 9 published in view of the order passed by this Court on 12.12.1996 in T.N. Godavarman, wherein it has been held that Forest (Conservation) Act, 1980 , would apply to lands being forests, irrespective of who owned the land. For that purpose, Shri Naphade, has drawn our attention to para 4.2 of the Report of the Committee, dated 19.5.2010 (Annexure R-5A) to I.A. No. 23 of 2010. 17. It is settled legal proposition that even if an order is void, it requires to be so declared by a competent forum and it is not permissible for any person to ignore the same merely because in his opinion the order is void. 18. In State of Kerala v. M.K. Kunhikannan Nambiar Manjeri Manikoth Naduvil (dead) & Ors., AIR 1996 SC 906; Tayabbhai M. Bagasarwalla & Anr. v. Hind Rubber Industries Pvt. Ltd. etc, AIR 1997 SC 1240; M. Meenakshi & Ors. v. Metadin Agarwal (dead) by L.Rs. & Ors. (2006) 7 SCC 470; and Sneh Gupta v. Devi Sarup & Ors. , (2009) 6 SCC 194, this Court held that whether an order is valid or void, cannot be determined by the parties. For setting aside such an order, even if void, the party has to approach the appropriate forum. 10 19. In State of Punjab & Ors. v. Gurdev Singh, Ashok Kumar , AIR 1991 SC 2219, this Court held that a party aggrieved by the invalidity of an order has to approach the court for relief of declaration that the order against him is inoperative and therefore, not binding upon him. While deciding the said case, this Court placed reliance upon the judgment in Smith v. East Ellore Rural District Council, [1956] 1 All ER 855 wherein Lord Radcliffe observed:- ""An order, even if not made in good faith is still an act capable of legal consequences. It bears no brand of invalidity on its forehead. Unless the necessary proceedings are taken at law to establish the cause of invalidity and to get it quashed or otherwise upset, it will remain as effective for its ostensible purpose as the most impeccable of orders."" 20. In Sultan Sadik v. Sanjay Raj Subba & Ors. , AIR 2004 SC 1377, this Court took a similar view observing that once an order is declared non-est by the Court only then the judgment of nullity would operate erga omnes i.e. for and against everyone concerned. Such a declaration is permissible if the court comes to the conclusion that the author of the order lacks inherent jurisdiction/competence and therefore, it comes to the conclusion that the order suffers from patent and latent invalidity. 11 21. Thus, from the above it emerges that even if the order/notification is void/voidable, the party aggrieved by the same cannot decide that the said order/notification is not binding upon it. It has to approach the court for seeking such declaration. The order may be hypothetically a nullity and even if its invalidity is challenged before the court in a given circumstance, the court may refuse to quash the same on various grounds including the standing of the petitioner or on the ground of delay or on the doctrine of waiver or any other legal reason. The order may be void for one purpose or for one person, it may not be so for another purpose or another person. 22. Be, that as it may, the matter regarding the validity of the said Notification is still pending consideration in a suit before the Bombay High Court on its original side, it is not desirable on our part to consider the said submission raised on behalf of the appellants. 23. The relevant part of the conditional order of the District Collector dated 27.1.2010 provides as under: (i) The Applicants will only carry out the repairs of the Bund and shall not carry out any other construction activities on the said land. 12 (ii) The Applicants will not destroy mangroves and/or vegetation on the said land. (iii) The Applicants shall not raise the height of the Bund above as in existence at present. On receiving numerous complaints from the public at large and officials, the District Collector passed the order dated 20.5.2010: ""xx xx xx The earlier order passed by this authority giving permission to repair the bund is hereby stayed and all the concerned parties should maintain status quo. xx xx xx This committee will visit and check minutely the following important points in the matter:- a) The permission given by the District Collector for the repair of the bund No.C/Desk-21 Mangrove/WS- 610/2009 dated 27.1.2010, which was rendered by the Supreme court in its orders dated 22.3.2010 and 7.5.2010 whether terms and conditions mentioned in the Collectors order are followed by the Applicant land owner or not? b) Whether the Applicant has committed any violation? c) Whether the land owner has kept water culverts open or not? If the committee finds that the water is stopped which may ultimately cause destroying of mangroves, the committee i.e. Area Officers should make the owner to open the culverts immediately. The committee should make detailed enquiry and the consolidated report should be sent to the District Collector within 15 days."" 13 After receiving the report from the Committee duly constituted by the District Collector on 20.5.2010, the District Collector passed the order on 26.5.2010 directing the appellants as under: 1) All the material used for filling to increase the height be removed, maintain the earlier position of the bund as expected in the permission order dated 27.1.2010. 2) Remove the rubble dumped in the open land in question. 3) Remove the rubble and filling and let the natural flow of sea water, which is at present obstructed, entering inside the S.No. in question. 4) Remove filling used for increasing the height of bund to the height as expected in the permission order dated 27.1.2010. 24. The aforesaid order has been passed by the Collector after considering various reports of experts/officers. (A) The report submitted by the Sub Divisional Officer, Mumbai Suburban District dated 18.5.2010 (Annexure A-20 of Con. Pet. 266/2010) makes it clear that the Tahsildar Borivali and Additional Chitnis had visited the spot and found that a new bund had been made having the width of 10 ft. and height of bund 4 ft. and running to 1 to 1= KMs. There had been culverts in the old bund which were filled up. The natural flow of water existing earlier had been closed. The closure of the water supply had adverse effect on the existing 14 mangroves. The direction issued by the District Collector in his order permitting the construction of bund that adequate arrangement to ensure that mangroves are not damaged, has not been complied with and there has been a breach of the said condition. (B) Report dated 19.5.2010 from the Committee appointed for inspection reveal that after having inspection of the site, the Committee reached the conclusion that the appellants have grossly violated the conditions incorporated in the order of the District Collector dated 27.1.2010, permitting them to repair the bund. They have not only raised height of the bund but widened it so as to obstruct the flow of water in the creek which may cause damage to mangroves. There has been a violation of the order of the Collector; the order of the Bombay High Court, and the order of this Court. The mangroves at places were destroyed during the construction of the new roads and the new bunds. Debris, garbage, mud and stones have been dumped along the new road. Large quantities of mud have been excavated from the site itself and used for construction of the bund. The Committee made the following recommendations: (1) That all illegal work should be immediately stopped by the revenue authority. 15 (2) The Bund and the Road that have blocked the smaller creeks should be immediately removed to prevent the destruction of the mangroves. (3) Proper action as per the law may be taken by the revenue authority. It is brought to the notice that in writ petition no. 3246 of 2004 the Maharashtra Govt. vide circular dated 21.10.2005 clarified that the Collector should take care of the mangroves of the private land and Government lands till the area is handed over to forest department. (C) There is another report of the Tahsildar Borivali Mumbai, Suburban district dated 22.5.2010 which reveals that earlier some culverts were in existence, the same had been closed and a new mud bund erected thereon. By making a huge filling, the width of the bund had been expanded by 12 to 15 ft. At the end of bund again filling of debris had been done. Branches of the adjacent mangroves had been cut. The report further reveals that a crime had been registered on 22.5.2010 in MHB Police Station under Section 15(i)(ii) of Environment Protection Act, 1986 against the owner of the land on account of the cutting of branches of mangroves, causing damage to mangroves and stoppage of the natural water flow of nalla. (D) Another report dated 14.6.2010 of a Committee consisting of six State officials is on record. According to it, there have been 16 flagrant violations of the order passed by the District Collector and the courts. The relevant part reads as under: CONCLUSIONS: Conditions in order Factual position observed dated 27.1.2010 by the Committee on the spot i) The applicants will No structural construction only carry out the activities carried out on the repairs of the Bund site, but it is observed that and shall not carry out the permission holder has any other construction done massive filling work activities on the said by dumping debris and land. garbage on the said land. Bund has been widened by mud and debris filling. Now the permission holder converted existing bund into new road. The permission was only to repair the existing bund. But the land holder has constructed a new bund. ii) The applicants will not Destruction of mangroves destroy mangroves and vegetation done in a and/or vegetation on large scale. the said land. iii) The Applicants shall Permission holder has not raise the height of raised height of the existing the Bund above as in bund by 1.5 Mtrs. as well existence at present. as width of the bund. iv) Upon completion of Compliance report of work the repairs, the has been submitted by the Applicant shall file a applicant. Despite that Completion Report in work still going on the site. the office of the Collector. v) The Applicant will Applicant violated the 17 abide by the final conditions of the order orders that may be dated 22.3.2010 passed by passed by the Hon'ble the Hon. Supreme Court in Supreme Court in the S.L.P. No.29031 of 2009. SLP to Appeal No.29031 of 2009 in respect of the user of the land. 25. The issue has been agitated from time to time before this Court and there have been various claims and counter claims in respect of the activities of the appellants. This Court vide order dated 24.11.2010 requested the learned Principal Judge, City Civil Court, Mumbai to inspect the area i.e. the bund in the lands i.e. SL. No.344 measuring 175 Hectares, situated in village Dahisar and submit a report to this Court about the status and present position. It was further requested that he would ascertain and report whether any damage has been caused to mangroves/vegetation that existed on the said land. 26. In pursuance of the said order, the learned Principal Judge, City Civil Court submitted the report dated 10.12.2010 along with a large number of photographs to substantiate the contents of the report. Relevant part thereof reads as under: 18 ""At the outset it may be briefly stated that during the course of visit it was noticed that the debris and boulders including big broken pieces of RCC slabs were found lying at various places on the bund. The debris and boulders were found used for pitching or reinforcement of the bund because of the dumping of debris and boulders on a large scale....Apart from dumping of debris and boulders in large quantities, what was noticed was that there were about 12 to 13 places where big platforms were found made of debris and boulders. The length of those platforms was something between 25 to 35 metres each and width was on an average 16 to 20 metres each.....That debris was being dumped beyond the area of the platform in property survey No.344 and there was an attempt to increase the width of the platforms. In the process the mangroves obviously were being destroyed. ..... the mangroves were destroyed at a considerable length from the bund in survey no.344..... the destruction was at considerably a large scale. ....a large number of mangroves were found cut manually. It was possible that the mangroves were cut to increase width of the bund. The cut mangroves were found to have been used in increasing the height of the bund. Breathing roots and branches of mangroves were found stuck in the muddy area of the bund. ..... The said bund appeared to have been erected after excavation of mud from both sides of the bund..... Mangroves were found cut at many places. The mangroves were found to have died because of removal of mud and stagnation of water..... .... There were 3-4 patches where mangroves appeared to have been destroyed manually.""(Emphasis added) 27. The CRZ Regulations define for regulating developmental activities, coastal stretches within 500 metres of the landward side of 19 the High Tide Line into 4 categories. Category I (CRZ-I) is defined as under: ""(i) Areas that are ecologically sensitive and important, such as, national parks/marine parks, sanctuaries, reserved forests, wildlife habitats, mangroves, corals/coral reefs, areas closed to breeding and spawning grounds of fish and other marine life, areas of outstanding natural beauty/historical/heritage areas, areas rich in genetic diversity, areas likely to be inundated due to rise in sea level consequent upon global warming and other such areas as may be declared by the Central Government or the concerned authorities at the State/Union Territory level from time to time."" (emphasis added) 28. The regulation of development or construction activities in CRZ-I areas is to be in accordance with the following norms: ""CRZ-I xxxxx Between LTL and HTL in areas which are not ecologically sensitive and important, the following may be permitted : (a) Exploration and extraction of Natural Gas; (b) activities as specified under proviso of sub- paragraph (i) and (ii) of paragraph 2; (c) Construction of dispensaries, schools, public rain shelters, community toilets bridges, roads, jetties, water supply, drainage, sewerage which are required for traditional inhabitants of the Sunderbans Biosphere Reserve area, West Bengal, on a case to case basis, by the West Bengal State Coastal Zone Management Authority; (d) salt harvesting by solar evaporation of sea water; (e) desalination plants; (f) storage of non-hazardous cargo such as edible oil, fertilizers and food grain within notified ports; (g) construction of trans-harbour sea links."" (emphasis added) 20 29. From the above, it is evident that mangroves fall squarely within the ambit of CRZ-I. The regulations allow for salt harvesting by solar evaporation of sea water in CRZ-I areas only where such area is not ecologically sensitive and important. In the instant case it has been established that mangrove forests are of great ecological importance and are also ecologically sensitive. Thus, salt harvesting by solar evaporation of sea water cannot be permitted in an area that is home to mangrove forests. 30. In view of the aforesaid discussion, we reach the following inescapable conclusions: (1) The land in dispute has not been used for manufacturing of salt for more than two decades. (2) The land in dispute stands notified as a reserve forest, though it may be a private land and requires to be protected. (3) The direction issued by the High Court while disposing of the writ petition filed by the Action Group has issued several directions including the direction to identify mangrove area and declare/notify it as a forest. 21 (4) The Central Regulatory Zone Regulations 1991 imposes certain restrictions on the land in dispute. (5) The District Collector while deciding the application of the applicants for according permission to repair the bund has explicitly incorporated the conditions that the appellants would only repair the old bund without raising its height and ensure full protection of mangroves. (6) This Court while disposing of the appeal filed by the appellants has directed to ensure compliance of the order of the District Collector and in case of any kind of violation to bring the matter to the notice of the court. (7) In respect of the repairing of the bund, a large number of complaints had been made to the authorities concerned, by the public, representatives of the people and various officials and statutory authorities alleging that the appellants have violated the conditional order passed by the District Collector for permitting the appellants to repair the bund. (8) Various reports submitted to the authorities concerned make it clear that there have been flagrant violations of the conditional order and that included : 22 (i) Closing the natural flow of water which has adverse effect on existing mangroves; (ii) A large number of mangroves had been cut/destroyed while repairing the bund and a large number of mangroves were found cut manually; (iii) Height and width of the bund had been increased to an unwarranted extent. The reports reveal that width of the bund had been extended by 12 ft. to 15 ft. while the old bund was not beyond 6 ft width. (iv) Instead of mud, big boulders, concrete, debris had been used. Several platforms of 25 to 30 mtrs with the width of 16 to 20 mtrs. have been constructed; (v) Debris was being dumped beyond the area of platform in the land in dispute making an attempt to increase the width of the platform; (vi) The cut mangroves have been used to increase the height of the bund; (vii) Breathing roots and branches of mangroves were found stucking out of the muddy area of the bund; and 23 (viii) A large number of mangroves died because of removal of mud and stagnation of water. 31. In view of the above, we have no hesitation to hold that the appellants are guilty of willful defiance of the orders passed by this Court as well as by the District Collector and they have filed the contempt petitions using it as a legal thumb screw to enforce their claims though, totally unwarranted and unfounded on facts. It is a crystal clear case of contumacious conduct, as the conduct of the appellants not explainable otherwise, for the reason that disobedience is deliberate. The appellants cannot be permitted to make allegations against the authorities and drag them to the court alleging disobedience of the orders of this court without realising that contempt proceedings are quasi criminal in nature. They have knowingly and purposely damaged the mangroves and other vegetation of the wet land of the CRZ-I area, which could not have been disturbed. Under the garb of repairing the old bund, a sort of pukka bund using boulders, and debris has been constructed along with a huge platform, violating the norms of environmental law and in flagrant violation and utter disregard of orders passed by the courts 24 and the District Collector. No court can validate an action which is not lawful at its inception. It is often re-iterated that justice is only blind or blindfolded to the extent necessary to hold its scales evenly. It is not, and must never be allowed, to become blind to the reality of the situation, lamentable though that situation may be. 32. In view of the above, the contempt proceedings filed by the District Collector and the Action Group are allowed and the contempt petition filed by the appellants i.e. Cont. Pet. 169/2010 is hereby dismissed with the following directions: (1) The appellants are directed to restore the height and width of the bund as it was existing prior to the order passed by the District Collector dated 27.1.2010 within a period of 60 days from today by removing all debris, grit, boulders etc., dismantling of platforms and reducing the height and width of the bund. 25 (2) All culverts, drains which existed prior to 27.1.2010 which could facilitate the natural flow of sea water into the land, shall be restored (3) In case the appellants fail to carry out the aforesaid directions within the stipulated period, the District Collector, Suburban District shall carry out the aforesaid directions and recover the cost from the appellants as arrears of land revenue and shall ensure in future that the appellants would not act in a manner detrimental to the ecology of the area and ensure the preservation of mangroves and other vegetation. 26 33. In the facts and circumstances of the case, we request the Bombay High Court to expedite the trial of the suit filed by the appellants. In view of the above, the contempt petitions and interlocutory application stand disposed of. ..........................J. (P. SATHASIVAM) ..........................J. (Dr. B.S.

"Subramani & Anr vs State Rep.By Inspector Of Police on 20 January, 2011","605","SUBRAMANI & ANR. ...APPELLANTS Versus STATE REP. BY INSPECTOR OF POLICE .....RESPONDENT O R D E R HARJIT SINGH BEDI, J. 1. This appeal arises out of the following facts: The deceased, Manoharan, was residing with his third wife PW-1 in Vendambadi Kudi Street. He was also claiming a share in the bank deposits left in the Cooperative Bank at Namakkal, by his aunt. This claim was opposed by A-1, his father, A-2 and A-3, the husbands of his sisters, A-4 son of A-2, A-5 his second wife and A-6 the brother of A-5, and there was some amount of friction between them on account of these conflicting claims. At about 1:30 a.m., on the 6th January, 2002, PW-1 and the deceased were sleeping in their house when A-3, A-5 and A-6 armed with bamboo sticks, A-4 armed with a reaper and A-1 with a stone reached that place and on the exhortation of A-1 that the deceased should be finished off, he was attacked by all the accused. The deceased Crl. Appeal No.605 of 2007 also attempted to 2 escape but in that effort he fell down whereupon A-4 hit him on the skull, A-2 attacked him with a knife and A-1 with a stone on his head. PW-1, who had seen the incident, went close to her husband and found that he was dead. She immediately went to the Panchayat President who directed her to approach the police. She accordingly reached police station, Namakkal at about 6:30 a.m. and lodged a report and a case under Sections 147 , 148 and 302 of the Indian Penal Code was registered. The Inspector of police, PW-16, thereafter took up the investigation, visited the site, made the necessary enquiries and sent the dead body for its post mortem examination. The post-mortem, performed by PW-9, revealed 24 injuries on the dead body. The accused were also arrested and pursuant to the disclosure statements made by A-1 and A- 2, the weapons used by them were recovered. On the completion of the investigation, the accused were charged for offences punishable under Sections 147 , 148 , 149 and 302 of the Indian Penal Code. They pleaded not guilty and were brought to trial. 2. The Trial Court, relying on the evidence of PW-1, the only eye- witness, held that A-2, A-3, A-4 and A-6 were guilty of the offence under Section 302 read with Section 149 of the Indian Penal Code. The Court, however, acquitted A-1 and A-5 of the charge of murder but found them guilty under Sections 147 and 148 of the Indian Penal Code and awarded them a sentence under those provisions. The Trial Court accordingly Crl. Appeal No.605 of 2007 sentenced A-2, A-3, 3 A-4 and A-6 to life imprisonment under Section 302 / 149 of the Code. 3. An appeal was thereafter filed in the High Court by the accused. This appeal was partly allowed and the conclusions drawn were: "" For the foregoing reasons, the conviction and sentence imposed upon A-2 to A-6 under Section 147 of I.P.C. are set aside, and they are acquitted of the said charge. The conviction and sentence imposed upon A-2 to A-6 under Section 148 of I.P.C. are set aside, and they are acquitted of the said charge. So far as the conviction and sentence imposed upon A-3 and A-6 under Section 302 read with 149 of I.P.C . are concerned, the same are set aside, and they are acquitted of the said charge. The conviction of A-2 under Section 302 read with 149 of I.P.C . is set aside, and instead he is convicted under Section 302 of I.P.C. The life sentence imposed on A-2 is confirmed. So far as A-4 is concerned, the conviction and sentence imposed upon him under Section 302 read with 149 of I.P.C . are set aside, and instead, he is convicted under Section 324 of I.P.C. and directed to suffer one year's Rigorous Imprisonment"" A-2 and A-4 are before us by way of special leave. 4. In the course of the hearing, Mr. Vijay Francis, the learned counsel for the appellants, has raised pleas similar to those raised in the Courts below. He has first submitted that there was no independent witness to the incident and in the light of the fact that there was no light in the house where the murder had happened and more particularly as there was admittedly grave animosity between the parties, it appeared that the PW-1 had not been able to identify the accused and that they had been involved on mere suspicion or on account of strained relations. It has also been submitted that these possibilities had been facilitated by the Crl. Appeal No.605 of 2007 fact that though the 4 incident is alleged to have happened at about 1:30 a.m. and the police station was only 5 km. away, the FIR had been lodged after a long delay. It has also been pleaded that in the facts of the case, it appeared that the intention of A-2 was not to cause death but he had the knowledge that death could be caused and as such, he was liable for an offence punishable under Section 304 (II) of the Indian Penal. 5. The learned counsel for the respondent has, however, supported the judgment of the High Court. 6. We see that PW-1 is the wife of the deceased whereas the accused are his close relatives. The facts show the deep set rancour between PW- 1 and the deceased on the one side and the accused on the other. Viewed in the light of this family dispute, there is no reason whatsoever for PW-1 to have excluded the true assailants. PW-1 clearly stated as to the manner in which the incident had happened and that she had been a witness from a very short distance. Even assuming, therefore, that there was some uncertainty as to the presence of a light, that would not in any manner detract from the value of PW-1's evidence, as the parties were very well-known to each other and the weapons used were those which would bring the victim PW-1 and the assailants in very close proximity to each other. The spontaneity of the recording of the First information Report supports the prosecution story. PW-1 was the widow of the deceased and his third wife. She would be the only person at home with the deceased at 1.30 a.m. and no other witness could be expected at that Crl. Appeal No.605 of 2007 hour. It is obvious 5 that she was also friendless in the village as the rest of the family had, in a manner, ganged up against her and her deceased husband and even the Panchayat President had made no attempt to help her and had advised her to approach the police. It is natural therefore, that she would have taken a couple of hours to gather her wits and then to leave for the police station 5 km away. The special report was delivered to the Magistrate within a few minutes of 6:30 a.m. We, therefore, find that there was absolutely no delay in the recording of the FIR and that in a manner corroborates the prosecution story. In any case, the courts below have given the benefit of doubt to most of the accused and, we must say, that the High Court has, perhaps, erred in acquitting some of them. In the light of the fact, however, that there is no State appeal against acquittal, we are unable to interfere in this matter. We also find that medical evidence clearly supports a case of murder against A-2 who was armed with a knife. The doctor, PW-9, who had conducted the post-mortem examination found the following injuries on the person of the deceased : 1. Cut injury of 8 x 2 cm x bone deep present over the center of the skull. 2. A punctured wound 2 cm x 1 cm x bone deep present center of the skull cm behind the first wound. 3. Cut injury of 3 cm x 2 x 1 cm present behind the right ear. 4. A lacerate wound of 3 cm x 2 x bone deep present below the first wound. Crl. Appeal No.605 of 2007 6 5. A lacerated wound of 4 cm x 2 cm x bone deep present 6 cm behind the right ear. 6. A cut injury of 3 x 1 cm x bone deep present over the right temporal region. 7. A lacerated wound of 4 cm x 2 x 2 cm over the left side of the nose. 8. An abrasion of 4 cm present over the right frontal palm of right thumb. 9. Multiple scratch marks present behind the right elbow; right forearm, and back of right hand. 10. A cut injury of 5 x 2 cm x 2 cm present over the right palm of right thumb. 11. Abrasion of 6 cm present below the right nipple. 12. Abrasion of 5 cm right lower abdomen. 13. Multiple scratch marks present over the left chest, back of the left elbow, outer aspect of the left wrist, outer aspect of right thigh, front of right knee joint. 14. Contusion outer aspect of right thigh. 15. Abrasion of 5 cm present over the outer aspect of right leg. 16. Punctured wound of 2 cm x 1 cm x bone deep over the lower 1/3 of right leg of outer aspect. 17. Multiple scratch marks present over the outer aspect of right foot. 18. Bone deformity present over the lower 1/3 of right leg. 19. An abrasion of 4 cm present over the outer aspect of middle third of left thigh. 20. Contusion present over the posterior aspect of M/3 of left thigh. Crl. Appeal No.605 of 2007 7 21. Multiple scratch marks present over the upper third of posterior aspect of left leg and lateral aspects of left foot. 22. Punctured wound of 3 x 2 x bone deep present below the left knee joint. 23. A lacerated wound 4 X 2 cm x bone deep present over the upper 6/3rd of left leg. 24. A lacerated wound of 3 cm x 2 cm x bone deep present over the lower 3 of the left leg. Extremities. 1.Fracture of right tibia L/3 present 2.Fracture of right tibia upper third. Skull 1.blood clots present over the right temporal region, 2. right temporal bole lacerated. He also opined that injury Nos. 1 and 2 could have been caused with a knife and that these two injuries had caused the death of the deceased. The Trial Court and High Court have both held that as A-2 had caused these injuries, he alone was liable for the murder, more particularly as they were both on the head. We also see that the High Court was, perhaps, not justified in acquitting A-4 of the charge of murder and finding him guilty under Section 324 only as the facts show that he too had been armed with a lethal weapon and had attacked the deceased while he lay asleep. To say, therefore, that there was no common intention to commit murder appears to be rather farfetched. However, in the light of the fact that the State Government has not chosen to file an appeal, we are constrained to accept the situation as it is. The appeal is therefore dismissed. Crl.

Dattu Bench: H.L. Dattu , D.K. Jain REPORTABLE IN THE SUPREME COURT OF INDIA CIVIL APPEALATE JURISDICTION CIVIL APPEAL NO. 3626 OF 2005 Medley Pharmaceuticals Ltd. ........... Appellant Versus The Commissioner of Central Excise & Customs, Daman ..............Respondent WITH CIVIL APPEAL NOS.1354-1355 OF 2010 Medley Pharmaceuticals Ltd. .............. Appellant Versus The Commissioner of Central Excise, Gujarat ..............Respondent JUDGMENT H.L. Dattu, J. 1) A group of three appeals is filed by the appellant - Medley Pharmaceuticals Ltd., under Section 35 L (b) of the Central Excise 1 Act, 1944 (hereinafter referred to as `the Act'). In Civil Appeal No.3626 of 2005, the appellant calls in question the correctness or otherwise of the order passed by Customs Excise and Service Tax Appellate Tribunal (CESTAT) (in short, ""The Tribunal"") in Appeal No. E/549 to E 551/2003-Mum, dated 3.12.2004. By the impugned order, the Tribunal has confirmed the order passed by Commissioner of Customs and Central Excise, Valsad dated 30.12.2002. In this appeal, the appellant has raised the following question of law for our consideration and decision:- ""Whether Physician samples manufactured and distributed as free samples have to be assessed on the basis of cost of manufacture plus normal profits, if any, earned on the sale under Rule 6(b)(ii) of the Central Excise Valuation Rules, 1975 (for short, ""Rules 1975"") upto 1st July, 2000 and thereafter, on application of Rule 8 of Central Excise Valuation Rules, 2000 (for short, ""Rules 2000"") i.e. on cost of manufacture plus 15% profit basis and not on pro-rata basis as has been done by the Revenue?"" 2) The Commissioner, while passing the order in Original No. 01/MP/Valsad/2002 dated 30.12.2002, has held that the value should 2 be determined under Rule 4 of Rules 1975. In the appeal filed by the appellant, the Tribunal, following the judgment in the case of Mayo India Ltd. and Cheryl Laboratories (P) Ltd., held that the value of Physician samples should be determined in accordance with the principle laid down in Rule 6(b)(i) read with Rule 7 of the Rules 2000. After coming to the aforesaid conclusion, the Tribunal has accepted the method of assessable value adopted by the Commissioner, though it was under Rule 4 of the Rules 1975. 3) In Civil Appeal Nos. 1354-1355 of 2010, the appellant is aggrieved by the final order passed by the Tribunal, bearing No.A/490/WZB /AHD/2009 dated 27th February, 2009 and the order No.H/853/WZB/AHD/2009 dated 4th August, 2009 passed on the rectification application in Appeal No. E/384/2005. By the impugned order, the Tribunal dismissed the appellant's appeal and upheld the order passed by the Commissioner of Central Excise (Appeals) dated 24th November, 2004 holding that for the purpose of payment of Excise duty, Physician samples have to be valued for the period post 1st July, 2000 upto December, 2001 on pro-rata basis on the value of trade packs under Rule 4 read with Rule 11 of the Central Excise Valuation (Determination of Price of Excisable Goods) Rules 2000. 3 The Tribunal, while rejecting the application filed for rectification of the order dated 27th February, 2009, held that merely because a product is statutorily prohibited from being sold, would not mean that the product is not capable of being sold. In this appeal, the appellant has raised the following questions of law for our consideration and decision. They are:- (A)Whether ""Physician Samples"" are excisable goods in view of the fact that they are statutorily prohibited from being sold under the Drugs and Cosmetics Act, 1940 (in short, "" Drugs Act "") and the Rules made thereunder? (B)If physician's samples are held to be excisable, then what is the appropriate method of valuing physician samples for the purpose of excise duty? 4) Shri S. Ganesh, learned senior counsel for the appellant, submitted that the Physician Samples of Patent and proprietory medicines come into existence as a manufactured product only when the same are labeled and packed for the purpose of sale and distribution. Our attention is invited to Note 5 of Chapter 30 of Central Excise Tariff Act, 1985 , wherein it is provided that packing and labeling would 4 amount to manufacture. Therefore, it is contended that the Physician Samples of Patent and proprietary Medicines become manufactured goods only when the same are packed and labeled. It is further contended that the physician samples of patent and proprietory medicines, at the time they are manufactured, are statutorily prohibited from being sold by virtue of Section 18 of the Drugs Act read with Rule 65(18) of the Drug Rules and the breach of the Drug Rules invites prosecution under Section 27(d) of the Drugs Act, and also invites penalty under Section 27(c) of the Drugs Act. It is further submitted that the two conditions that require to be satisfied for levy of excise duty are existence of manufacturing process and as a result of such process, goods are produced which are capable, in the ordinary course, of being taken to the market for being bought and sold. It is further submitted that the word `excisable goods' has been construed to mean not only goods specified in the Schedule to the Central Excise Tariff Act, 1985 , but also goods which are capable of being sold i.e. marketable. In the present case, the `Physician Samples' are statutorily prohibited from being sold and therefore, do not satisfy the twin test required to make physician samples excisable goods. 5 5) Shri R. P. Bhatt, learned senior counsel for the Revenue, justifies the reasoning and conclusion reached by the Tribunal. 6) In pith and substance, the submission of learned senior counsel Shri Ganesh is that the physician samples of patent and proprietary medicines are statutorily prohibited from being sold by virtue of Rule 65(18) and Rule 95 and Rule 96 (1) (ix) of the Drugs Rules. It is contended that every drug intended for distribution as physicians sample while complying with the labeling provisions under Drugs and Cosmetic Rules further bear on the label of the container the words ""Physician's Sample- Not to be Sold"" requires to be over printed and further, the sale of such Physician samples is expressly prohibited under Rule 65 (18) of the Drug Rules. He contends that patent and proprietory drugs are excisable only after the labeling is complete. Since these physician samples cannot be sold in the market after the completion of the labeling in view of the statutory prohibition, the physician samples are not marketable and hence, no excise duty is leviable on their manufacture. 7) The Central Excise Act , apart from others, provides for charging of duty, valuation etc. Section 3 of the Act is the charging 6 provision. It states, there shall be levied and collected in such a manner as may be prescribed duties on excisable goods which are produced or manufactured in India. Basic excise duty and special excise duty are levied under the charging provision at the rates specified in First and Second Schedule to Central Excise Tariff Act, 1985 . The duty is on excisable goods which are manufactured or produced in India. This Court in Shinde Brothers vs. Deputy Commissioner , AIR 1967 SC 1512 has held that excise duty is imposed on goods, and the taxable event for the levy is manufacture or production of the goods. A duty of excise is a tax upon the goods and not upon sales or proceeds of sale of goods. In terms of Entry 84, List I of Seventh Schedule to the Constitution, taxable event in respect of excise is manufacture or production (See CCE vs. Acer India Ltd. , 2004 AIR SCW 5496). The levy is on the manufacture or production of goods. The collection is shifted to stage of removal. Since excise is a duty on manufacture, duty is payable whether or not goods are sold. Therefore, sale is not necessary condition for charging excise duty. This Court in the case of Ram Krishna Ramanath Agarwal Vs. Secretary, Municipal Commissioner, Kamptee 1950 SCR 15, has referred to the distinction made by the Federal Court between the duty 7 of excise and a tax on sale in Province of Madras vs. Boddu Paidanna and Sons (1942) FCR 90, wherein it is observed: "" Plainly, a tax levied on the first sale must, in the nature of things, be a tax on the sale by the manufacturer or producer; but it is levied upon him qua seller and not qua manufacturer or producer. It may well be that a manufacturer or producer is sometimes doubly hit... If the taxpayer who pays sales tax is also a manufacturer or producer of commodities subject to a central duty of excise, there may no doubt be overlapping in one sense, but there is no overlapping in law. The two taxes which he is called on to pay are economically two separate and distinct imposts. There is, in theory, nothing to prevent the Central Legislature from imposing a duty of excise on a commodity as soon as it comes into existence no matter what happens to it afterwards, whether it be sold consumed, destroyed, or given away... It is the fact of manufacture which attracts the duty even though it may be collected later. In the case of a sales tax, the liability to tax arises on the occasion of a sale and a sale has no necessary connection with manufacture or production."" ..."" [emphasis supplied] 8) The consistent view of this Court is that for the purpose of levy of excise duty, an article must satisfy two requirements to be `Goods' i.e. (a) it must be movable and (b) it must be marketable. In these appeals, we are primarily concerned whether the `Goods' namely Physician samples of patent and proprietory medicines intended for distribution to the medical practitioner as free samples, satisfies the test of `Marketability'. Marketability is an essential criteria for 8 charging duty. The test of marketability is that the product which is made liable to duty must be marketable in the condition in which it emerges. The word `Marketable' means saleable or suitable for sale. It need not in fact be marketed. The article should be capable of being sold to consumers, as it is without anything more. The essence of marketability of goods is neither in the form nor in the shape or condition in which the manufactured article is found. It is the commercial identity of the article known to the market for being bought and sold. The fact that the product in question is generally not being bought or sold or has no demand in the market, would be irrelevant. [See Indian Cable Co. Ltd. vs. CCE , 1994(74) ELT 22(SC)]. We will now refer to some of the decisions of this Court, which have explained the concept of `Marketability' for the purpose of the Act. 9) The Constitution Bench of this Court, in the case of Union of India vs. Delhi Cloth and General Mills , AIR 1968 SC 922, after referring to definition of `excisable goods', stated: ""These definitions makes it clear that to become goods an article must be something which can ordinarily come to the market to be bought or sold"". 9 10) A three Judge Bench of this Court in the case of Union Carbide India Ltd. v. Union of India , (1986) 2 SCC 547 has discussed the concept of `marketability' in order for the Revenue to impose excise duty as under: ""6. It does seem to us that in order to attract excise duty the article manufactured must be capable of sale to a consumer. Entry 84 of List I of Schedule VII to the Constitution specifically speaks of ""duties of excise on tobacco and other goods manufactured or produced in India...."", and it is now well accepted that excise duty is an indirect tax, in which the burden of the imposition is passed on to the ultimate consumer. In that context, the expression ""goods manufactured or produced"" must refer to articles which are capable of being sold to a consumer. In Union of India v. Delhi Cloth & General Mills , AIR 1963 SC 791, this Court considered the meaning of the expression ""goods"" for the purposes of the Central Excises and Salt Act, 1944 and observed that ""to become `goods' an article must be something which can ordinarily come to the market to be brought and sold"", a definition which was reiterated by this Court in South Bihar Sugar Mills Ltd. v. Union of India , AIR 1968 SC 922"". 11) In Bhor Industries Ltd. vs. Collector of Central Excise, Bombay , (1989) 1 SCC 602, it was held: ""Excise is a duty on goods as specified in the Schedule. The taxable event in the case of excise duties is the manufacture of goods. Under the Central Excise Act , as it stood at the relevant time, in order to be goods as specified in the entry, it was essential that as a result manufacture goods 10 must come into existence. For articles to be goods these must be known in the market as such or these must be capable of being sold in the market as goods. Actual sale in the market is not necessary, user in the captive consumption is not determinative but the articles must be capable of being sold in the market or known in the market as goods. It is, therefore, necessary to find out whether there are goods, that is to say, articles as known in the market as separate distinct identifiable commodities and whether the tariff duty levied would be as specified in the Schedule. Simply because a certain article falls within the Schedule it would not be dutiable under excise law if the said article is not `goods' known to the market. Marketability, therefore, is an essential ingredient in order to be dutiable under the Schedule to Central Excise Tariff Act, 1985 ."" 12) In Hindustan Polymers v. CCE (1989) 4 SCC 323, this Court observed: ""11. Excise duty is a duty on the act of manufacture. Manufacture under the excise law, is the process or activity which brings into being articles which are known in the market as goods and to be goods these must be different, identifiable and distinct articles known to the market as such. It is then and then only that manufacture takes place attracting duty. In order to be goods, it was essential that as a result of the activity, goods must come into existence. For articles to be goods, these must be known in the market as such and these must be capable of being sold or are being sold in the market as such. In order, therefore, to be manufacture, there must be activity which brings transformation to the article in such a manner that different and distinct article comes into being which is known as such in the market."" 11 13) In A.P. State Electricity Board vs. CCE, Hyderabad , (1994) 2 SCC 428, this Court stated: ""Marketability is an essential ingredient in order to be dutiable under the Schedule to the Act .......The `marketability' is thus essentially a question of fact to be decided in the facts of each case. There can be no generalization. The fact that the goods are not in fact marketed is of no relevance. So long as the goods were marketable, they are goods for the purposes of Section 3 . It is not also necessary that the goods in question should be generally available in the market. Even if the goods are available from only one source or from a specified market, it makes no difference so long as they are available for purchasers..... The marketability of articles does not depend upon the number of purchasers nor is the market confined to the territorial limits of this country."" 14) In Indian Cable Company Ltd.., Calcutta vs. Collector of Central Excise and Others , (1994) 6 SCC 610, this Court has stated: ""Marketability is a decisive test for dutiability. It only means `saleable' or ""suitable for sale"". It need not be in fact `marketed'. The article should be capable of being sold or being sold, to consumers in the market, as it is ---- without anything more."" 12 15) In Triveni Engineering & Industries Ltd. v. CCE , (2000) 7 SCC 29, this Court, while demonstrating the attributes of excisable goods under the excise law, has observed that: ""13. ... The article in question should be capable of being brought and sold in the market -- a test which is too well established by a series of decisions of this Court to be elaborated here."" 16) In Union of India v. Sonic Electrochem (P) Ltd. , (2002) 7 SCC 435, this court has held: ""9. ... It is difficult to lay down a precise test to determine marketability of articles. Marketability of goods has certain attributes. The essence of marketability is neither in the form nor in the shape or condition in which the manufactured articles are to be found, it is the commercial identity of the articles known to the market for being bought and sold. The fact that the product in question is generally not being bought and sold or has no demand in the market would be irrelevant."" 17) In the case of ITC Ltd. v. Collector of Central Excise, Patna , (2003) 1 SCC 678, this Court while applying the test of marketability for the purpose of levy of excise duty on the manufacture of the cigarette, has observed: 13 ""17. From a conspectus of the aforesaid decisions, it would be clear that for the purposes of levy of excise duty, the test to be applied is whether the goods manufactured are marketable or not. In the present case, the cigarette, which is the end product of tobacco, is fit for consumption before the same is removed for test. Packing of the cigarettes cannot be said to be incidental or ancillary to the manufacturing process, but the same may be incidental or ancillary to its sale only. In case it is laid down that packing of cigarettes is incidental or ancillary to the completion of manufactured products, the same may result in evasion of excise duty as before packing the cigarettes the same may be regularly supplied to each and every employee for his consumption without payment of excise duty thereon. The definition of ""manufacture"" under Section 2(f) very clearly includes process which is incidental or ancillary to the completion of manufactured product. Manufacture of cigarette is completed when the same emerges in the form of sticks of cigarettes which are sent to the laboratory for quality control test. Sticks of cigarettes can be consumed and manufacture of the end product i.e. cigarette, which is commercially known in the market as such, is completed before its removal for test and after testing only packing of the same, which is the requirement of Rule 93 of the Rules, is done. Thus, we hold that sticks of cigarettes which are removed for the purpose of test in the quality control laboratory located within the factory premises of the appellant Company are liable to excise duty."" 18) In the case of Cadila Laboratories (P) Ltd v. CCE, Vadodara , (2003) 4 SCC 12, this Court has held: ""9. Thus the law is that in order to be excisable, not only goods must be manufactured i.e. some new product brought into existence, but the goods must be marketable. By marketable it does not mean that the goods must be actually 14 bought and sold in the market. But the goods must be capable of being bought or sold in the market. The law also is that goods which are in the crude or unstable form and which require a further processing before they can be marketed, cannot be considered to be marketable goods merely because they fall within the Schedule to the Excise Act "". 19) In Hindustan Zinc Ltd. v. CCE , (2005) 2 SCC 662, this Court observed: ""5. Excise duty is levied under Section 3 on goods manufactured or produced in India. Thus, before excise duty is levied on an item, even if it is mentioned in the tariff, two conditions have to be cumulatively satisfied, namely, that the process by which an item is obtained is a process of manufacture and that the item so obtained is commercially marketable and bought and sold in the market or known to be so in the market."" 20) In Dharampal Satyapal v. CCE , (2005) 4 SCC 337, it was held by this Court: ""18. ... Marketability is an attribute of manufacture. It is an essential criteria for charging duty. Identity of the product and marketability are the twin aspects to decide chargeability. Dutiability of the product depends on whether the product is known to the market. The test of marketability is that the product which is made liable to duty must be marketable in the condition in which it emerges. Marketable means saleable. The test of classification is, how are the goods known in the market. These tests have been laid down by this Court in a number of judgments including Moti 15 Laminates (P) Ltd. v. CCE ( 1995) 3 SCC 23, Union of India v. Delhi Cloth & General Mills Co. Ltd. ( 1997) 5 SCC 767 and Cadila Laboratories (P) Ltd. v. CCE (2003) 4 SCC 12"" 21) In Gujarat Narmada Valley Fertilizer Co. Ltd. vs. Collector of Excise and Customs, (2005) 7 SCC 94, it was held that unless the product is capable of being marketed and is known to those who are in the market, as having an identity as a distinct and identifiable commodity, that the article is subject to excise duty. Simply because certain articles fall within the Schedule does not make them marketable. Actual sale in market is not necessary, but the articles must be capable of being sold in the market or known in the market as goods. 22) In Moriroku UT India (P) Ltd. vs. State of Uttar Pradesh and Ors. , (2008) 4 SCC 548, it was observed that excise duty is a levy on a taxable event of `manufacture'. Liability under excise law is event based on manufacture and irrespective of whether the goods are sold or captively consumed. Excise duty is not concerned with ownership or sale. 16 23) Having said so in so far as exciseability of Goods for the purpose of duty under the Act, we may notice the purpose and object of Drugs Act . In our opinion, the main object or real purpose of the Drugs Act, 1940 and Rules made thereunder, is to regulate the manufacture of drugs in order to maintain the standard or quality of drugs for sale and distribution as a drug. This Court in State of Bihar v. Shree Baidyanath Ayurved Bhawan (P) Ltd. , (2005) 2 SCC 762, has held: ""14. ... The object of the Drugs Act is to maintain the quality of drugs as drugs. Its use as any other commodity in the hands of the consumer is not regulated. Hence, the Drugs Act is relatable to Entry 19 of List III, which deals with drugs and poisons, subject to Entry 59 of List I regarding opium. Lastly, the said Act regulates the manufacture of drug for sale and distribution as a drug."" 24) Therefore, any requirement or condition imposed by the Drugs Act and Rules made thereunder, is in furtherance of its above stated object of regulating and maintaining the quality of Drugs. 25) The primary object of the Act is to raise revenue by imposing duty on goods that are manufactured as mentioned above (see Kedia Agglomerated Marbles Ltd. v. CCE , (2003) 2 SCC 494). In other words, the scope of the Act extends to the event of manufacture of goods, for the levy of excise duty. These two Statutes and the Rules 17 made thereunder, operate in entirely two different fields having different objects, purposes and schemes. The conditions or restrictions contemplated by one statute should not be lightly and mechanically imported and applied to fiscal statue for non levy of excise duty, thereby causing a loss of revenue. This Court in CCE v. Shree Baidyanath Ayurved Bhavan Ltd. , (2009) 12 SCC 419 has held: ""55. True it is that Section 3(a) of the Drugs and Cosmetics Act, 1940 defines ""Ayurvedic, siddha or unani drug"" but that definition is not necessary to be imported in the new Tariff Act . The definition of one statute having different object, purpose and scheme cannot be applied mechanically to another statute. As stated above, the object of the Excise Act is to raise revenue for which various products are differently classified in the new Tariff Act ."" 26) Therefore, the prohibition on the sale of Physician Samples intended for distribution to medical practitioners as free samples by Rule 65 (18) of the Drugs Rules shall have no bearing or effect upon the levy of excise duty under the Act, since excise is a duty on manufacture, duty is payable whether or not goods are sold. Excise duty is payable even in case of free supply, since sale is not a necessary condition for charging duty under the Act. 18 27) Even assuming that Shri. Ganesh is correct, when he contends that physician samples are not allowed to be sold in the open market in view of the statutory prohibition on their sale, and hence are not marketable; the Revenue is only concerned with the manufacture of the goods and the possibility of marketability of the goods. When the product is manufactured by a Pharmaceutical Company, it is for the purpose of sale i.e., every such product including Physician Sample is capable of being sold in the open market, but the pharmaceutical company makes the choice to distribute the same as a free sample. In other words, it is not mandatory for the pharmaceutical company to distribute free physician samples of every drug they manufacture. This choice made by the pharmaceutical companies in terms of Rule 96 (1) (ix) of the Drugs Rules by overprinting words `Physician's sample- Not to be sold' on the label of the drugs will not come in the way of the Revenue from levying excise duty on the drugs so manufactured. 28) We agree with Shri Ganesh, learned senior counsel for the appellant, that the manufacture of patent and proprietary drugs is completed only after the labelling is completed, for the purpose of levy of excise duty. However, on a perusal of the labelling provisions in the Drug Rules, we find that they deal with the name of drug, contents of the drug, 19 name and address of manufacturer, a distinctive batch number (details of manufacture of drug is recorded and available for inspection as a particular batch), preparation of drug, date of manufacture and date of expiry of drug, its storage conditions, etc., which are in aid of the object of the Act, viz. promoting the use of good quality drugs, and ensuring that drugs that do not live upto quality do not find their way into the market. Rule 96 (1) (ix) of the Drug Rules on which Shri Ganesh heavily relies in support of his submission, states that while complying with the labelling provisions under clauses (i) to (viii) of Rule 96 (1), the manufacturer must further overprint on the label `Physician's Sample - Not to be Sold', in case they are to be distributed free of cost as physicians samples. Further, the bare perusal of Rule 96 shows that its heading bears `Manner of Labelling' and clause 1 of this Rule contemplates or govern the manner of labelling in a way that the particulars on the label of the container of a drug shall be either printed or written in indelible ink and shall appear in conspicuous manner. This gives ample clarification that the process of labelling is distinct or different from the overprinting on the label of a physician's sample, and hence we are unable to agree with him that the manufacture for the purpose of the Central Excise Tariff Act 20 is not completed until `Physicians Sample - Not to be Sold' is printed on the label. 29) The primary reason of distributing free physician samples by the manufacturer of pharmaceutical drugs to us appears to be only for the purpose of advertising of the product and thereby enhancing the sale of the product in the open market. It has been shown by research that the market of a pharmaceutical company is enhanced substantially by the distribution of free physician samples. In other words, the distribution of such physician samples serves as a marketing tool in the hands of the pharmaceutical companies [See Sarah L. Cutrona et al., Characteristics of Recipients of Free Prescription Drug Samples: A Nationally Representative Analysis, 98 Am. J. Pub. Health 284 (2008)]. 30) Before we conclude, in our view, the issue raised in these appeals is no more res-integra. This issue came up for consideration before this Court in the case of Ranbaxy Laboratories Ltd. Vs. Commissioner of Central Excise, Pune , (2003) 9 SCC 199, wherein it was held: ""1. In these appeals, the question is whether free medical samples supplied to the doctors are liable to excise duty. In our view, this question is answered by a decision of this Court rendered today in Civil Appeal No. 3643-44 of 1999. 21 2. However, in these matters one further question arises i.e. how are the samples to be valued. The question arises as to whether the price of physician samples are to be worked out on pro-rata basis for the samples as per Section 4(1)(b) of the Central Excise Act read with Rules 7 and 6(b) of the Central Excise (Valuation) Rules, 1975 or on some other basis. The Tribunal has not decided this question even after holding that the goods were excisable. We, therefore, remit these matters back to the Tribunal for a decision on this point. The appeals stand disposed of accordingly. No order as to costs."" 31) This Court, while passing the aforementioned order, has relied on the judgment and order passed in the case of Bharat Heavy Electricals Ltd. v. Commissioner of Customs & Central Excise , (2003) 9 SCC 185 [referred to as Civil Appeal No. 3643-44 of 1999], in which this Court held: ""4. It is next submitted that the value of an assessable goods can be zero. It is submitted that when a part is replaced under a warranty to the assessee the value is zero. It is submitted that as the value is zero, no excise duty should be payable on that part. We are unable to accept this submission also. In order to promote sales manufacturers and dealers very often offer incentives e.g. supply of free TV or some other equipment or goods. One of the incentives offered, is a warranty to replace a part within a particular period. Merely because manufacturers and dealers choose to offer such incentives does not mean that goods which are otherwise excisable, should be exempted from paying excise duty. When offering the incentive, the manufacturer or dealer is choosing to take upon himself the cost of those goods. So far as the Revenue is concerned, those goods remain excisable."" 22 32) This Court has consistently held that the medical supplies supplied to the Doctors are liable to excise duty. Elaborate consideration may not be forthcoming in these judgments, but, in our view, the issue stands concluded. We say so for the reason that this Court, in catena of cases, has opined that in case, the appeal has been dismissed in the absence of detailed reasons or without reasons, such order will entail the application of the doctrine of merger, wherein the superior court upholds the decision of the lower court from which the appeal has arisen. In the case of V.M. Salgaocar & Bros.( P) Ltd. Vs. C.I.T. , (2000) 5 SCC 373, this Court held: ""8. Different considerations apply when a special leave petition under Article 136 of the Constitution is simply dismissed by saying ""dismissed"" and an appeal provided under Article 133 is dismissed also with the words ""the appeal is dismissed"". In the former case it has been laid by this Court that when a special leave petition is dismissed this Court does not comment on the correctness or otherwise of the order from which leave to appeal is sought. But what the Court means is that it does not consider it to be a fit case for exercise of its jurisdiction under Article 136 of the Constitution. That certainly could not be so when an appeal is dismissed though by a non-speaking order. Here the doctrine of merger applies. In that case, the Supreme Court upholds the decision of the High Court or of the Tribunal from which the appeal is provided under clause (3) of Article 133. This doctrine of merger does not apply in the case of dismissal of a special leave petition under Article 136."" 23 33) In the case of Kunhayammed v. State of Kerala , (2000) 6 SCC 359, it was held: ""41. Once a special leave petition has been granted, the doors for the exercise of appellate jurisdiction of this Court have been let open. The order impugned before the Supreme Court becomes an order appealed against. Any order passed thereafter would be an appellate order and would attract the applicability of doctrine of merger. It would not make a difference whether the order is one of reversal or of modification or of dismissal affirming the order appealed against. It would also not make any difference if the order is a speaking or non-speaking one. Whenever this Court has felt inclined to apply its mind to the merits of the order put in issue before it though it may be inclined to affirm the same, it is customary with this Court to grant leave to appeal and thereafter dismiss the appeal itself (and not merely the petition for special leave) though at times the orders granting leave to appeal and dismissing the appeal are contained in the same order and at times the orders are quite brief. Nevertheless, the order shows the exercise of appellate jurisdiction and therein the merits of the order impugned having been subjected to judicial scrutiny of this Court. 42. ""To merge"" means to sink or disappear in something else; to become absorbed or extinguished; to be combined or be swallowed up. Merger in law is defined as the absorption of a thing of lesser importance by a greater, whereby the lesser ceases to exist, but the greater is not increased; an absorption or swallowing up so as to involve a loss of identity and individuality. (See Corpus Juris Secundum, Vol. LVII, pp. 1067-68.)"" 24 34) It is settled law that this Court should follow an earlier decision that has withstood the changes in time, irrespective of the rationale of the view taken. It was held by a Constitution Bench in the case of Waman Rao v. Union of India , (1981) 2 SCC 362: ""40. It is also true to say that for the application of the rule of stare decisis, it is not necessary that the earlier decision or decisions of longstanding should have considered and either accepted or rejected the particular argument which is advanced in the case on hand. Were it so, the previous decisions could more easily be treated as binding by applying the law of precedent and it will be unnecessary to take resort to the principle of stare decisis. It is, therefore, sufficient for invoking the rule of stare decisis that a certain decision was arrived at on a question which arose or was argued, no matter on what reason the decision rests or what is the basis of the decision. In other words, for the purpose of applying the rule of stare decisis, it is unnecessary to enquire or determine as to what was the rationale of the earlier decision which is said to operate as stare decisis. ..."" 35) Now we may notice the decisions on which reliance placed by learned senior counsel Shri Ganesh. In Delhi Cloth and General Mills Vs. Joint Secretary , 1978(2) ELT (J121) (Delhi High Court), the question before the court was whether calcium carbide, which does not comply with regard to purity and packaging with statutory rules answers the test of `Marketability'. The Court on facts has found that the calcium carbide manufactured by the company was 25 for further utilization in the production of acetylene gas was not of purity that rendered it marketable nor was it packed in such a way as to make it marketable that is to say, in air tight containers. The Court has further noticed that the commodity in question would require further processing to make it marketable and therefore, the commodity in question is not marketable and hence, not excisable. 36) Reliance is placed on the decision of CESTAT in Amar Lal Vs. CCE , (2004) 172 ELT 466. That was a case where assessee manufactured a new drug for trial which were supplied for clinical trials. In view of the Drugs Control Act and the Rules framed thereunder, any drug could be marketed only after successful clinical trials and after approval and licence from Drugs Controller. Hence, the Tribunal held that the drug supplied free for clinical trials is not excisable Goods as it cannot be bought and sold at that stage. 37) In Pfizer vs. Commissioner of Central Excise 2002 (146) ELT 477, the question before the Tribunal was, whether excise duty is leviable on `Sugar syrup' manufactured by the assessee for use in the manufacture by it for cough syrup. The Tribunal, while answering the issue, has stated that since the sale of Sugar Syrup containing artificial 26 sweetener sodium saccharin would contravene the provisions of Prevention of Food Adulteration Rules, the Goods cannot be considered as marketable. 38) In Hindustan Petroleum Corporation Ltd. vs. CCE , (2007) 210 ELT 407 (CESTAT), it was a case where assessee manufactured `diesel stem' by refining the sour crude for captive consumption and sale in the market. The sale of `diesel stem' containing high sulphur content was prohibited by Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Gas in the light of the notification issued by Ministry of Environment and Forest for preventing environmental pollution caused by emission due to burning of sulphur along with fuel. In the light of the notification issued by Ministry of Environment & Forest, the `diesel stem' in its high content of sulphur is incapacitated from being sold in the market. In other words, this inherent incapability in the ingredients of the Goods, from being sold in the market makes it non-marketable and hence not excisable. 39) In Himalaya Drug Company vs. C.C.E. , (2005) 187 ELT 427, the question before the Tribunal was, whether the excise duty is leviable on `vegetable extracts' manufactured by the assessee for 27 use in the manufacture of Ayurvedic, Unani or Siddha Medicines. The Tribunal, while answering the issue, concluded that such vegetable extracts, unless subjected to preservative process, are not liable to be considered as Goods attracting excise duty and such Goods should be considered as only intermediary Goods. Further, in view of the fact that the licence issued by the Drug Controller prohibits assessee from selling such semi finished products. Therefore, the Tribunal concluded that such intermediary or semi finished Goods manufactured by assessee cannot be compared with the products manufactured by others for sale, for the purpose of `marketability'. 40) In our considered view, the reliance placed by the learned senior counsel for the appellant on some of the decisions of the Tribunal would not assist him in support of his submission for the reason that the goods therein were not marketable and hence, excise duty was not leviable, not because of any statutory prohibition for the sale of the goods, but because they had not reached the stage of satisfying the test of marketability of the goods. 28 41) Now coming to the valuation of the physician samples for the purpose of levy of excise duty, in our view, this issue need not detain us long in view of the decision of this Court in the case of Commissioner of Central Excise vs. M/s. Bal Pharma [Civil Appeal No. 1697 of 2006]. This Court has upheld the conclusion of the Tribunal that the physician's samples have to be valued on pro-rata basis. The Tribunal, while arriving at the aforesaid conclusion, had relied upon its earlier decision in the case of Commissioner of Central Excise, Calicut vs. Trinity Pharmaceuticals Pvt. Ltd. , reported as 2005 (188) ELT 48, which has been accepted by the department. Therefore, we hold that physician samples have to be valued on pro-rata basis for the relevant period. 42) In view of the above discussion, we pass the following order:- a) Civil Appeal No. 3626 of 2005 is allowed and the matter is remitted to the Adjudicating Authority with a direction to value the goods in question on pro-rata basis for the relevant period. 29 b) We dismiss Civil Appeal Nos. 1354-1355 of 2010. Parties to bear their own costs. ..................... .........J. [ D.K. JAIN ] ...............................J. [ H.L. DATTU ] New Delhi, January 14, 2011. 30"

Lodha , Aftab Alam REPORTABLE IN THE SUPREME COURT OF INDIA CIVIL APPELLATE JURISDICTION CIVIL APPEAL NO.6924 OF 2005 Pushpa @ Leela & Ors. ... Appellants Versus Shakuntala & Ors. ... Respondents JUDGMENT AFTAB ALAM, J. 1. Whether in the fact and circumstances of the case the liability to pay the compensation amount as determined by the Motor Accident Claims Tribunal was of the purchaser of the vehicle alone or whether the liability of the recorded owner of the vehicle was coextensive and from the recorded owner it would pass on to the insurer of the vehicle? This is the short 2 question that arises for consideration in this appeal by special leave filed at the instance of the claimants. 2. The appellants, claimants before the Claims Tribunal are the heirs and legal representatives of one Prem Chand who died in a motor accident on May 7, 1994. Prem Chand had hired the truck bearing registration no.HPA- 1435 for carrying some materials and food articles for a wedding in the family. He got the materials to be transported loaded on the truck by a labourer, Nikku Ram whom he had engaged for that purpose and took him along with him on the truck for unloading the consignment at the destination. According to the claimants, the driver Roop Ram was driving the truck rashly and at a very high speed. As a result, the truck met with an accident and at about 6.30-7pm while running on Dhararu Dhar Road near Bangora, Tehsil Arki, District Solan, in the State of Himachal Pradesh, it went off the road and overturned leading to the death of all the three persons, including the driver. 3. The truck had a little history of its own that actually gives rise to the question set out at the beginning of the judgment. It earlier belonged to one Jitender Gupta who was its registered owner. Jitender Gupta sold the truck to Salig Ram on February 2, 1993 and gave its possession to the transferee. On the date of the sale, the truck was covered by an insurance policy taken out 3 by Jitender Gupta from New India Assurance Company Ltd. The insurance policy was issued on February 25, 1992 and it was due to expire on February 24, 1993. Despite the sale of the vehicle by Jitender Gupta to Salig Ram, the change of ownership of the vehicle was not entered in its certificate of registration. After the earlier policy issued by New India Assurance Company Ltd. expired on February 24, 1993, there was a period when the truck was not covered by any insurance policy. Later on, however, Salig Ram took out an insurance policy for the truck from Oriental Insurance Company Ltd. bearing policy no.31/94/00628. The policy was taken in the name of Jitender Gupta, the earlier owner of the truck, and it was valid from December 8, 1993 to December 7, 1994. The accident in which Prem Chand and Nikku Ram lost their lives took place on May 7, 1994, i.e. during the period when the policy taken out from the Oriental Insurance Company Ltd. was subsisting and valid. 4. The heirs and legal representatives of both the deceased, Prem Chand and Nikku Ram filed separate claim applications before the Motor Accident Claims Tribunal, Solan, Himachal Pradesh. In both the claim applications Salig Ram, the transferee was impleaded as respondent no.1, Jitender Gupta, the original owner of the truck as respondent no.2 and Oriental Insurance Company Ltd. as respondent no.3. The two claim applications, MAC 4 petition no.62-NS/2 of 1994 filed by the heirs and legal representatives of the deceased Prem Chand (appellants in this appeal) and MAC petition no.63-NS/2 of 1994 filed by the heirs and legal representatives of the deceased Nikku Ram (who pursued the matter only up to the High Court and who have not been able to come to this Court in appeal) were consolidated and heard together. All the three respondents appeared before the Tribunal and filed their separate replies resisting the claims of the two claimants. But none of the respondents led any evidences before the Claims Tribunal. 5. The Claims Tribunal, on the basis of the ex parte evidence adduced on behalf of the claimants, found and held that both Prem Chand and Nikku Ram died on May 7, 1994, in the accident caused by truck no.HPA-1435 which was being driven by its driver Roop Ram in a rash and negligent manner. It also found that Prem Chand and Nikku Ram were not travelling in the ill-fated truck as unauthorised or gratuitous passengers. The Claims Tribunal further held that the heirs and legal representatives of Prem Chand were entitled to a sum of Rs.5,04,000/- for the loss of dependency and Rs.10,000/- for loss of consortium and Rs.2000/- as cremation charges. The heirs and legal representatives of Prem Chand were, thus, held entitled to a total compensation of Rs.5,16,000/-. In case of the heirs and legal 5 representatives of the deceased Nikku Ram, the Claims Tribunal held that they were entitled to a total compensation of Rs.2,42,000/-. 6. Coming next to the question of liability of payment, the issue that is most crucial for the claimants from the practical point of view, the Claims Tribunal held that no liability for payment of compensation to the claimants would attach to Jitender Gupta since he had ceased to be the owner of the vehicle after its sale to Salig Ram on February 2, 1993. It further held that even though an insurance policy for the truck was taken out from Oriental Insurance Company Ltd., the policy was in the name of Jitender Gupta, who was no longer the owner of the truck on the date the policy was taken out and there was no privity of contract between Salig Ram, the owner of the truck and the insurance company. Hence, the insurance policy was of no use for indemnifying Salig Ram, the owner of the truck. In short, Salig Ram alone was liable for payment of the compensation amount to the two claimants. In this connection, the Claims Tribunal in paragraph 46 of its judgment held and observed as followed: ""Because the subsequent policy was taken by respondent no.2 effective from 08.12.1993 to 07.12.1994 when he was not owner having no right, title or interest to obtain the policy. The owner at that time was respondent no.1 who never entered into any privy of contract with respondent no.3 to cover third party risks qua the vehicle."" 6 7. Against the judgment and award made by the Claims Tribunal the claimants filed appeals before the Himachal Pradesh High Court being FAO no.459 of 2000 (by the heirs and legal representatives of Prem Chand) and FAO no.77 of 1999 (by the heirs and legal representatives of Nikku Ram). Both the appeals were dismissed by the High Court by a common judgment and order dated July 15, 2004. 8. We have examined the judgments passed by the Claims Tribunal and the High Court and we find that both the Tribunal and the High Court addressed the question of the liability of the recorded owner of the vehicle on the basis of a provision that has no relevance to the issue. Both the Tribunal and the High Court discussed at length the provision of section 157 of the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988 (""the Act"" for short) that deals with ""Transfer of Certificate of Insurance"". So far as that section is concerned the Tribunal and the High Court were right in holding that section 157 of the Act would apply only to the earlier policy (being that of New India Assurance Company Ltd.) taken out by Jitender Gupta during the validity period of which the truck was sold by him to Salig Ram and it can have no application to the second policy taken out from Oriental Insurance Company Ltd. in the name of Jitender Gupta after the sale of the truck. But as stated earlier, section 157 has no application in the facts of this case. 7 9. The question of the liability of the recorded owner of the vehicle has to be examined under different provisions of the Act. Section 2(30) of the Act defines ""owner"" in the following terms: ""2(30) ""owner"" means a person in whose name a motor vehicle stands registered, and where such person is a minor, the guardian of such minor, and in relation to a motor vehicle which is the subject of a hire-purchase agreement, or an agreement of lease or an agreement of hypothecation, the person in possession of the vehicle under that agreement;"" (Emphasis added) 10. Then, section 50 of the Act lays down the procedure for transfer of ownership. It is a long section and insofar as relevant it is reproduced below: ""50. Transfer of ownership. (1) Where the ownership of any motor vehicle registered under this Chapter is transferred,- (a) the transferor shall,- (i) in the case of a vehicle registered within the same State, within fourteen days of the transfer, report the fact of transfer, in such form with such documents and in such manner, as may be prescribed by the Central Government to the registering authority within whose jurisdiction the transfer is to be effected and shall simultaneously send a copy of the said report to the transferee; and (ii) xxxxxxx (b) the transferee shall, within thirty days of the transfer, report the transfer to the registering authority within whose jurisdiction he has the residence or place of 8 business where the vehicle is normally kept, as the case may be, and shall forward the certificate of registration to that registering authority together with the prescribed fee and a copy of the report received by him from the transferor in order that particulars of the transfer of ownership may be entered in the certificate of registration. (2) xxxxxxx (3) xxxxxxx (4) xxxxxxx (5) xxxxxxx (6) On receipt of a report under sub-section (1), or an application under subsection (2), the registering authority may cause the transfer of ownership to be entered in the certificate of registration. (7) A registering authority making any such entry shall communicate the transfer of ownership to the transferor and to the original registering authority, if it is not the original registering authority."" 11. It is undeniable that notwithstanding the sale of the vehicle neither the transferor Jitender Gupta nor the transferee Salig Ram took any step for the change of the name of the owner in the certificate of registration of the vehicle. In view of this omission Jitender Gupta must be deemed to continue as the owner of the vehicle for the purposes of the Act, even though under the civil law he ceased to be its owner after its sale on February 2, 1993. 9 12. The question of the liability of the recorded owner of a vehicle after its sale to another person was considered by this Court in Dr. T.V. Jose vs. Chacko P.M. , (2001) 8 SCC 748. In paragraphs 9 and 10 of the decision, the Court observed and held as follows: ""9. Mr. Iyer appearing for the Appellant submitted that the High Court was wrong in ignoring the oral evidence on record. He submitted that the oral evidence clearly showed that the Appellant was not the owner of the car on the date of the accident. Mr. Iyer submitted that merely because the name had not been changed in the records of R.T.O. did not mean that the ownership of the vehicle had not been transferred. Mr. Iyer submitted that the real owner of the car was Mr. Roy Thomas. Mr. Iyer submitted that Mr. Roy Thomas had been made party-Respondent No.9 to these Appeals. He pointed out that an Advocate had filed appearance on behalf of Mr. Roy Thomas but had then applied for and was permitted to withdraw the appearance. He pointed out that Mr. Roy Thomas had been duly served and a public notice had also been issued. He pointed out that Mr. Roy Thomas had chosen not to appear in these Appeals. He submitted that the liability, if any, was of Mr. Roy Thomas. 10. We agree with Mr. Iyer that the High Court was not right in holding that the Appellant continued to be the owner as the name had not been changed in the records of R.T.O. There can be transfer of title by payment of consideration and delivery of the car. The evidence on record shows that ownership of the car had been transferred. However the Appellant still continued to remain liable to third parties as his name continued in the records of R.T.O. as the owner. The Appellant could not escape that liability by merely joining Mr. Roy Thomas in these Appeals. Mr. Roy Thomas was not a party either before MACT or the High Court. In these Appeals we cannot and will not go into the question of inter se 10 liability between the Appellant and Mr. Roy Thomas. It will be for the Appellant to adopt appropriate proceedings against Mr. Roy Thomas if, in law, he is entitled to do so."" (Emphasis added) 13. Again, in P.P. Mohammed vs. K. Rajappan & Ors. , (2008) 17 SCC 624, this Court examined the same issue under somewhat similar set of facts as in the present case. In paragraph 4 of the decision, this Court observed and held as follows: ""4. These appeals are filed by the appellants. The insurance company has chosen not to file any appeal. The question before this Court is whether by reason of the fact that the vehicle has been transferred to Respondent 4 and thereafter to Respondent 5, the appellant got absolved from liability to the third person who was injured. This question has been answered by this Court in T.V. Jose (Dr.) v. Chacko P.M. wherein it is held that even though in law there would be a transfer of ownership of the vehicle, that, by itself, would not absolve the party, in whose name the vehicle stands in RTO records, from liability to a third person. We are in agreement with the view expressed therein. Merely because the vehicle was transferred does not mean that the appellant stands absolved of his liability to a third person. So long as his name continues in RTO records, he remains liable to a third person."" (Emphasis added) 14. The decision in Dr. T.V. Jose was rendered under the Motor Vehicles Act, 1939 . But having regard to the provisions of section 2(30) and section 50 of the Act, as noted above, the ratio of the decision shall apply with equal 11 force to the facts of the case arising under the 1988 Act. On the basis of these decisions, the inescapable conclusion is that Jitender Gupta, whose name continued in the records of the registering authority as the owner of the truck was equally liable for payment of the compensation amount. Further, since an insurance policy in respect of the truck was taken out in his name he was indemnified and the claim will be shifted to the insurer, Oriental Insurance Company Ltd. 15. Learned counsel for the insurance company submitted that even though the registered owner of the vehicle was Jitender Gupta, after the sale of the truck he had no control over it and the possession and control of the truck were in the hands of the transferee, Salig Ram. No liability can, therefore, be fastened on Jitender Gupta, the transferor of the truck. In support of this submission he relied upon a decision of this Court in National Insurance Company Ltd. vs. Deepa Devi & Ors., (2008) 1 SCC 414. The facts of the case in Deepa Devi are entirely different. In that case the vehicle was requisitioned by the District Magistrate in exercise of the powers conferred upon him under the Representation of the People Act, 1951 . In that circumstance, this Court observed that the owner of the vehicle cannot refuse to abide by the order of requisition of the vehicle by the Deputy Commissioner. While the vehicle remained under requisition, the 12 owner did not exercise any control over it: the driver might still be the employee of the owner of the vehicle but he had to drive the vehicle according to the direction of the officer of the State, in whose charge the vehicle was given. Save and except the legal ownership, the registered owner of the vehicle had lost all control over the vehicle. The decision in Deepa Devi was rendered on the special facts of that case and it has no application to the facts of the case in hand. 16. In light of the discussion made above it is held that the compensation amount is equally realisable from respondent no.3, Oriental Insurance Company Ltd. and it is directed to make full payment of the compensation amount as determined by the Claims Tribunal to the appellants within two months from the date of this judgment. 17. Even though the claimants in the other case, the heirs and legal representatives of Nikku Ram, have not come to this Court, we consider it appropriate to give the same direction in respect of their case. There is absolutely no difference in the case of Nikku Ram and Prem Chand. Nikku Ram, being a daily wage earner was given a compensation of Rs.2,42,000/-. It is quite possible that his heirs and legal representatives were unable to come to this Court simply for want of sufficient means. The insurance company must pay the compensation amount determined in case of Nikku 13 Ram to his heirs and legal representatives in case the amount has so far not been realised from Salig Ram as directed by the Claims Tribunal. 18. The appeal is allowed but with no order as to costs. ....................................J. (AFTAB ALAM) ....................................J. (R.M. LODHA) New Delhi January 12, 2011."
"State Of U.P vs Chhoteylal on 14 January, 2011","769","State of U.P. ...Appellant Versus Chhoteylal ...Respondent JUDGEMENT R.M. LODHA, J. The State of Uttar Pradesh is in appeal, by special leave, because the High Court of Judicature at Allahabad, Lucknow Bench, Lucknow reversed the judgment of the trial court and acquitted the respondent. 2. The prosecution case in brief is this: On September 19, 1989 the prosecutrix (name withheld by us) had gone to relieve herself in the evening. Ram Kali (A-3) followed her on the way. While she was returning and reached near the plot of one Vijai Bahadur, Chhotey Lal (A-1) and Ramdas (A-2) came from behind; A-1 caught hold of her and when she raised alarm, A-1 showed fire-arm to her and gagged her mouth. A-1 along with A-2 and A-3 brought the prosecutrix upto the road. There, A-3 parted company with A-1 and A-2. A-1 and A-2 then took the prosecutrix to Village Sahora. On the night of September 19, 1989, the prosecutrix was kept in the house of Girish and Saroj Pandit in Village Sahora. On the next day i.e., September 20, 1989, in the wee hours, A-1 and A-2 took the prosecutrix in a bus to Shahajahanpur where she was kept in a rented room for few days. During their stay in Shahajahanpur, A-1 allegedly committed forcible intercourse with the prosecutrix. Whenever prosecutrix asked for return to her house, A-1 would gag her mouth and threaten her. In the meanwhile, Rampal - brother of the prosecutrix - made a complaint to the Superintendent of Police, Hardoi on September 28, 1989 that A-1, A-2 and A-3 have kidnapped her sister (prosecutrix) on September 19, 1989. Based on this 2 complaint, the First Information Report (FIR) was registered on September 30, 1989. The prosecutrix was recovered by the police on October 13, 1989 from Shahabad - Pihani Road near Jalalpur culvert. On that day itself, the prosecutrix was sent for medical examination to the Women Hospital, Hardoi where she was examined by Dr. Shakuntala Reddy. Ram Manohar Misra to whom the investigation of the case was entrusted then took steps for determination of the age of the prosecutrix as advised by the doctor and sent her for X-ray examination. 3. On October 17, 1989, the prosecutrix was produced before the Judicial Magistrate I, Hardoi, where her statement under Section 164 Cr.P.C. was recorded by the Judicial Magistrate. 4. A-1 was arrested on December 2, 1989. On completion of investigation, A-1 was chargesheeted for the offences punishable under Sections 363 , 366 , 368 and 376 of the Indian Penal Code ( IPC ); A-2 was chargesheeted under Sections 363 , 366 and 368 , IPC and A-3 under Sections 363 and 366 , IPC. 3 5. The prosecution in support of its case examined five witnesses, namely, complainant - Rampal (PW-1), prosecutrix (PW-2), Investigating Officer - Ram Manohar Misra (PW-3), Subhash Chandra Misra - Head Constable (PW-4) and Dr. Shakuntala Reddy (PW-5). 6. A-2 had died and the trial abated as against him. The III Additional Sessions Judge, Hardoi vide his judgment dated September 5, 1990 acquitted A-3 as the prosecution was not able to establish any case against her. However, on the basis of the prosecution evidence, the III Additional Sessions Judge held that the prosecutrix was about 17 = years of age at the time of occurrence of crime and found A-1 guilty under Sections 363 , 366 , 368 and 376 , IPC and sentenced him to undergo 7 years' rigorous imprisonment under Section 376 IPC and the different sentences for other offences which were ordered to run concurrently. 7. A-1 challenged the judgment passed by the III Additional Sessions Judge, Hardoi before the Allahabad High Court, Lucknow Bench, Lucknow. The High Court vide its judgment dated March 11, 2003 reversed the judgment of the 4 trial court and acquitted A-1. While acquitting A-1, the High Court gave three reasons, namely; (one) kidnapping took place on September 19, 1989 whereas the report of the occurrence was lodged after ten days and there was no reasonable and plausible explanation as to why the report could not be lodged promptly and why it had been delayed for ten days; (two) according to medical evidence, the prosecutrix was found to be 17 years of age and she could be even of 19 years of age at the time of occurrence and (three) no internal or external injury was found on her body and she was habitual to sexual intercourse. We deem it appropriate to reproduce the entire reasoning of the High Court as it is which reads as follows: ""It has been submitted by the learned counsel for the appellant that according to the prosecution, alleged kidnapping took place on 19-9-1989 whereas the report of the occurrence was lodged after ten days. There was no reasonable and plausible explanation forthcoming from the side of the prosecution as to why after alleged kidnapping of a minor girl a report could not be lodged promptly and why it has been delayed for ten days. This by itself shows that the report had been lodged after consultation and after due deliberation and the prosecution can be safely looked with doubt. I fully agree with the contention of the learned counsel for the appellant and furthermore, according to medical evidence on 5 record, girl in question was found 17 years of age and she could be even 19 years of age at the time of alleged occurrence. No internal or external injury was found on her body and she was used to sexual intercourse. The charge of rape also stands not proved. The learned court below was thus not justified in believing the prosecution theory and convicting the appellant."" 8. We are indeed surprised by the casual approach with which the High Court has dealt with the matter. The judgment of the High Court is not only cryptic and perfunctory but it has also not taken into consideration the crucial evidence on record. On flimsy grounds, the accused convicted of a serious crime of kidnapping and rape has been acquitted. There is no application of mind to the evidence of the prosecutrix at all. Having not been benefited by the proper consideration of the evidence by the High Court, we have looked into the entire evidence on record carefully. 9. Section 375 IPC defines rape as follows : "" S. 375 . Rape.--A man is said to commit ""rape"" who, except in the case hereinafter excepted, has sexual intercourse with a woman under circumstances falling under any of the six following descriptions :-- First.-- Against her will Secondly.-- Without her consent. Thirdly.-- With her consent, when her consent has been obtained by 6 putting her or any person in whom she is interested in fear of death or of hurt. Fourthly.-- With her consent, when the man knows that he is not her husband, and that her consent is given because she believes that he is another man to whom she is or believes herself to be lawfully married. Fifthly.-- With her consent, when, at the time of giving such consent, by reason of unsoundness of mind or intoxication or the administration by him personally or through another of any stupefying or unwholesome substance, she is unable to understand the nature and consequences of that to which she gives consent. Sixthly.-- With or without her consent, when she is under sixteen years of age. Explanation.--Penetration is sufficient to constitute the sexual intercourse necessary to the offence of rape. Exception.--Sexual intercourse by a man with his own wife, the wife not being under fifteen years of age, is not rape."" 10. Clause Sixthly--`with or without her consent, when she is under sixteen years of age' assumes importance where a victim girl is under sixteen years of age. The prosecutrix is an illiterate and rustic young woman. She does not seem to have had formal education and, therefore, there is no school certificate available on record. In the FIR, the age of the 7 prosecutrix has been stated to be 13 years. In her statement recorded under Section 164 , Cr.P.C., the prosecutrix stated that her age was 13 years. PW-1, who is elder brother of the prosecutrix, in his deposition also stated that the age of the prosecutrix was 13 years at the relevant time. However, the doctor - PW-5 on the basis of her X-ray as well as physical examination opined that the prosecutrix was 17 years of age. The trial court on consideration of the entire evidence recorded a categorical finding that the prosecutrix was about 17 = years of age at the time of occurrence. This is what the trial court said: ""According to the complainant Rampal, PW-2 was aged 13 years at the time of the occurrence, but during the cross-examination, the complainant has stated in para 7 of her cross examination that he was aged about 24 years and PW-2 was younger to him by 8-9 years. Thus, the age of the prosecutrix, according to the statement of the complainant appearing in para 7 of his cross examination, comes to about 15 or 16 years. PW- 2, the prosecutrix, gave her age as 13 years at the time of the occurrence. According to the supplementary report, Ext. Ka. 12 on record, prepared by Lady Dr. Shakuntala Reddy, P.W. 5, PW-2 was aged about 17 years. During the cross- examination, Lady Dr. Shakuntala Reddy, P.W. 5, has stated in para 9 of cross-examination that there could be a difference of 6 months both ways 8 in the age of PW-2. Thus PW-2 can be said to be aged 17 = years at the time of the occurrence."" 11. We find ourselves in agreement with the view of the trial court regarding the age of the prosecutrix. The High Court conjectured that the age of the prosecutrix could be even 19 years. This appears to have been done by adding two years to the age opined by PW-5. There is no such rule much less an absolute one that two years have to be added to the age determined by a doctor. We are supported by a 3-Judge Bench decision of this Court in State of Karnataka v. Bantara Sudhakara @ Sudha & Anr.1 wherein this Court at page 41 of the Report stated as under: ""Additionally, merely because the doctor's evidence showed that the victims belong to the age group of 14 to 16, to conclude that the two years' age has to be added to the upper age-limit is without any foundation."" 12. Learned counsel for the respondent relied upon a decision of this Court in the case of Mussauddin Ahmed v. State of Assam2 in support of his submission that the best 1 (2008) 11 SCC 38 2 (2009) 14 SCC 541 9 evidence concerning the age of prosecutrix having been withheld, the finding of the High Court that the prosecutrix could be 19 years of age cannot be said to erroneous. In the present case, the brother of the prosecutrix has been examined as PW- 1 and, therefore, it cannot be said that best evidence has been 2 withheld. The decision of this Court in Mussauddin Ahmed has no application at all. In our view, the High Court fell in grave error in observing that the prosecutrix could be even 19 years of age at the time of alleged occurrence. 13. Be that as it may, in our view, clause Sixthly of Section 375 IPC is not attracted since the prosecutrix has been found to be above 16 years (although below 18 years). In the facts of the case what is crucial to be considered is whether clause First or clause Secondly of Section 375 IPC is attracted. The expressions `against her will' and `without her consent' may overlap sometimes but surely the two expressions in clause First and clause Secondly have different connotation and dimension. The expression `against her will' would ordinarily mean that the intercourse was done by a man with a woman despite her resistance and opposition. On the other 10 hand, the expression `without her consent' would comprehend an act of reason accompanied by deliberation. The concept of `consent' in the context of Section 375 IPC has come up for consideration before this Court on more than one occasion. Before we deal with some of these decisions, reference to Section 90 of the IPC may be relevant which reads as under : "" S. 90 . Consent known to be given under fear or misconception.--A consent is not such a consent as it intended by any section of this Code, if the consent is given by a person under fear of injury, or under a misconception of fact, and if the person doing the act knows, or has reason to believe, that the consent was given in consequence of such fear or misconception; or Consent of insane person.--if the consent is given by a person who, from unsoundness of mind, or intoxication, is unable to understand the nature and consequence of that to which he gives his consent; or Consent of child.--unless the contrary appears from the context, if the consent is given by a person who is under twelve years of age."" 14. This Court in a long line of cases has given wider meaning to the word `consent' in the context of sexual offences as explained in various judicial dictionaries. In Jowitt's 11 Dictionary of English Law (Second Edition), Volume 1 (1977) at page 422 the word `consent' has been explained as an act of reason accompanied with deliberation, the mind weighing, as in a balance, the good or evil on either side. It is further stated that consent supposes three things--a physical power, a mental power, and a free and serious use of them and if consent be obtained by intimidation, force, meditated imposition, circumvention, surprise, or undue influence, it is to be treated as a delusion, and not as a deliberate and free act of the mind. 15. Stroud's Judicial Dictionary (Fourth Edition), Volume 1 (1971) at page 555 explains the expression `consent', inter alia, as under :- ""Every `consent' to an act, involves a submission; but it by no means follows that a mere submission involves consent,"" e.g. the mere submission of a girl to a carnal assault, she being in the power of a strong man, is not consent (per Coleridge J., R.v. Day, 9 C. & P. 724)."" Stroud's Judicial Dictionary also refers to decision in the case of Holman v. The Queen ([1970] W.A.R. 2) wherein it was stated: `But there does not necessarily have to be complete willingness to constitute consent. A woman's consent to 12 intercourse may be hesitant, reluctant or grudging, but if she consciously permits it there is ""consent"".' 16. In Words and Phrases, Permanent Edition, (Volume 8A) at pages 205-206, few American decisions wherein the word `consent' has been considered and explained with regard to the law of rape have been referred. These are as follows : ""In order to constitute ""rape"", there need not be resistance to the utmost, and a woman who is assaulted need not resist to the point of risking being beaten into insensibility, and, if she resists to the point where further resistance would be useless or until her resistance is overcome by force or violence, submission thereafter is not ""consent"". People v. McIlvain (55 Cal. App. 2d 322)."" .................... ............. "" ""Consent,"" within Penal Law, ' 2010, defining rape, requires exercise of intelligence based on knowledge of its significance and moral quality and there must be a choice between resistance and assent. People v. Pelvino, 214 N.Y.S. 577"" ...................... .......... "" ""Consenting"" as used in the law of rape means consent of the will and submission under the influence of fear or terror cannot amount to real consent. Hallmark v. State, 22 Okl. Cr. 422"" . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .. ""Will is defined as wish, desire, pleasure, inclination, choice, the faculty of conscious, and especially of deliberate, action. It is purely and 13 solely a mental process to be ascertained, in a prosecution for rape, by what the prosecuting witness may have said or done. It being a mental process there is no other manner by which her will can be ascertained, and it must be left to the jury to determine that will by her acts and statements, as disclosed by the evidence. It is but natural, therefore, that in charging the jury upon the subject of rape, or assault with intent to commit rape, the courts should have almost universally, and, in many cases, exclusively, discussed ""consent"" and resistance. There can be no better evidence of willingness is a condition or state of mind no better evidence of unwillingness than resistance. No lexicographer recognizes ""consent"" as a synonym of willingness, and it is apparent that they are not synonymous. It is equally apparent, on the other hand, that the true relation between the words is that willingness is a condition or state of mind and ""consent"" one of the evidences of that condition. Likewise resistance is not a synonym of unwillingness, though it is an evidence thereof. In all cases, therefore, where the prosecuting witness has an intelligent will, the court should charge upon the elements of ""consent"" and resistance as being proper elements from which the jury may infer either a favourable or an opposing will. It must, however, be recognized in all cases that the real test is whether the assault was committed against the will of the prosecuting witness. State v. Schwab, 143 N.E. 29"" 17. Broadly, this Court has accepted and followed the judgments referred to in the above judicial dictionaries as regards the meaning of the word `consent' as occurring in Section 375 IPC. It is not necessary to refer to all the decisions 14 and the reference to two decisions of this Court shall suffice. In State of H.P. v. Mango Ram3 , a 3-Judge Bench of this Court while dealing with the aspect of `consent' for the purposes of Section 375 IPC held at page 230 of the Report as under: ""Submission of the body under the fear of terror cannot be construed as a consented sexual act. Consent for the purpose of Section 375 requires voluntary participation not only after the exercise of intelligence based on the knowledge of the significance and moral quality of the act but after having fully exercised the choice between resistance assent. Whether there was consent or not, is to be ascertained only on a careful study of all relevant circumstances."" 18. In the case of Uday v. State of Karnataka4 , this Court put a word of caution that there is no straitjacket formula for determining whether consent given by the prosecutrix to sexual intercourse is voluntary, or whether it is given under a misconception of fact. The Court at page 57 of the Report stated : "".......In the ultimate analysis, the tests laid down by the courts provide at best guidance to the judicial mind while considering a question of consent, but the court must, in each case, 3 (2000) 7 SCC 224 4 (2003) 4 SCC 46 15 consider the evidence before it and the surrounding circumstances, before reaching a conclusion, because each case has its own peculiar facts which may have a bearing on the question whether the consent was voluntary, or was given under a misconception of fact.. . . . .."". 19. In the backdrop of the above legal position, with which we are in respectful agreement, the evidence of the prosecutrix needs to be analysed and examined carefully. But, before we do that, we state, as has been repeatedly stated by this Court, that a woman who is victim of sexual assault is not an accomplice to the crime. Her evidence cannot be tested with suspicion as that of an accomplice. As a matter of fact, the evidence of the prosecutrix is similar to the evidence of an injured complainant or witness. The testimony of prosecutrix, if found to be reliable, by itself, may be sufficient to convict the culprit and no corroboration of her evidence is necessary. In prosecutions of rape, the law does not require corroboration. The evidence of the prosecutrix may sustain a conviction. It is only by way of abundant caution that court may look for some corroboration so as to satisfy its conscience and rule out any 16 false accusations. In State of Maharasthra v. Chandraprakash Kewalchand Jain5, this Court at page 559 of the Report said: ""A prosecutrix of a sex-offence cannot be put on par with an accomplice. She is in fact a victim of the crime. The Evidence Act nowhere says that her evidence cannot be accepted unless it is corroborated in material particulars. She is undoubtedly a competent witness under Section 118 and her evidence must receive the same weight as is attached to an injured in cases of physical violence. The same degree of care and caution must attach in the evaluation of her evidence as in the case of an injured complainant or witness and no more. What is necessary is that the Court must be alive to and conscious of the fact that it is dealing with the evidence of a person who is interested in the outcome of the charge levelled by her. If the court keeps this in mind and feels satisfied that it can act on the evidence of the prosecutrix, there is no rule of law or practice incorporated in the Evidence Act similar to illustration (b) to Section 114 which requires it to look for corroboration. If for some reason the court is hesitant to place implicit reliance on the testimony of the prosecutrix it may look for evidence which may lend assurance to her testimony short of corroboration required in the case of an accomplice. The nature of evidence required to lend assurance to the testimony of the prosecutrix must necessarily depend on the facts and circumstances of each case. But if a prosecutrix is an adult and of full understanding the court is entitled to base a conviction on her evidence unless the same is shown to be infirm and not trustworthy. If the totality of the circumstances appearing on the record of the case disclose that the prosecutrix does not have 5 (1990) 1 SCC 550 17 a strong motive to falsely involve the person charged, the court should ordinarily have no hesitation in accepting her evidence."" 20. In State of Punjab v. Gurmit Singh & Ors.6 , this Court made the following weighty observations at pages 394-396 and page 403: ""The court overlooked the situation in which a poor helpless minor girl had found herself in the company of three desperate young men who were threatening her and preventing her from raising any alarm. Again, if the investigating officer did not conduct the investigation properly or was negligent in not being able to trace out the driver or the car, how can that become a ground to discredit the testimony of the prosecutrix? The prosecutrix had no control over the investigating agency and the negligence of an investigating officer could not affect the credibility of the statement of the prosecutrix.... The courts must, while evaluating evidence remain alive to the fact that in a case of rape, no self- respecting woman would come forward in a court just to make a humiliating statement against her honour such as is involved in the commission of rape on her. In cases involving sexual molestation, supposed considerations which have no material effect on the veracity of the prosecution case or even discrepancies in the statement of the prosecutrix should not, unless the discrepancies are such which are of fatal nature, be allowed to throw out an otherwise reliable prosecution case.... Seeking corroboration of her statement before replying upon the same as a rule, in such cases, amounts to adding insult to injury.... Corroboration as a condition for judicial reliance on the testimony of 6 (1996) 2 SCC 384 18 the prosecutrix is not a requirement of law but a guidance of prudence under given circumstances. The courts should examine the broader probabilities of a case and not get swayed by minor contradictions or insignificant discrepancies in the statement of the prosecutrix, which are not of a fatal nature, to throw out an otherwise reliable prosecution case. If evidence of the prosecutrix inspires confidence, it must be relied upon without seeking corroboration of her statement in material particulars. If for some reason the court finds it difficult to place implicit reliance on her testimony, it may look for evidence which may lend assurance to her testimony, short of corroboration required in the case of an accomplice. The testimony of the prosecutrix must be appreciated in the background of the entire case and the trial court must be alive to its responsibility and be sensitive while dealing with cases involving sexual molestations."" 21. In Vijay @ Chinee v. State of Madhya Pradesh7 , decided recently, this Court referred to the above two decisions of this Court in Chandraprakash Kewalchand Jain5 and Gurmit Singh6 and also few other decisions and observed as follows : ""Thus, the law that emerges on the issue is to the effect that the statement of the prosecutrix, if found to be worthy of credence and reliable, requires no 7 (2010) 8 SCC 191 19 corroboration. The court may convict the accused on the sole testimony of the prosecutrix."". 22. The important thing that the court has to bear in mind is that what is lost by a rape victim is face. The victim loses value as a person. Ours is a conservative society and, therefore, a woman and more so a young unmarried woman will not put her reputation in peril by alleging falsely about forcible sexual assault. In examining the evidence of the prosecutrix the courts must be alive to the conditions prevalent in the Indian society and must not be swayed by beliefs in other countries. The courts must be sensitive and responsive to the plight of the female victim of sexual assault. Society's belief and value systems need to be kept uppermost in mind as rape is the worst form of woman's oppression. A forcible sexual assault brings in humiliation, feeling of disgust, tremendous embarrassment, sense of shame, trauma and lifelong emotional scar to a victim and it is, therefore, most unlikely of a woman, and more so by a young woman, roping in somebody falsely in the crime of rape. The stigma that attaches to the victim of rape in Indian society ordinarily rules 20 out the leveling of false accusations. An Indian woman traditionally will not concoct an untruthful story and bring charges of rape for the purpose of blackmail, hatred, spite or revenge. This Court has repeatedly laid down the guidelines as to how the evidence of the prosecutrix in the crime of rape should be evaluated by the court. The observations made in the case of Bharwada Bhoginbhai Hirjibhai v. State of Gujarat8 deserve special mention as, in our view, these must be kept in mind invariably while dealing with a rape case. This Court observed as follows : ""9. In the Indian setting, refusal to act on the testimony of a victim of sexual assault in the absence of corroboration as a rule, is adding insult to injury. Why should the evidence of the girl or the woman who complains of rape or sexual molestation be viewed with the aid of spectacles fitted with lenses tinged with doubt, disbelief or suspicion? To do so is to justify the charge of male chauvinism in a male dominated society. We must analyze the argument in support of the need for corroboration and subject it to relentless and remorseless cross- examination. And we must do so with a logical, and not an opinionated, eye in the light of probabilities with our feet firmly planted on the soil of India and with our eyes focussed on the Indian horizon. We must not be swept off the feet by the approach made in the western world which has its own social milieu, its own social mores, its own 8 (1983) 3 SCC 217 21 permissive values, and its own code of life. Corroboration may be considered essential to establish a sexual offence in the backdrop of the social ecology of the western world. It is wholly unnecessary to import the said concept on a turnkey basis and to transplant it on the Indian soil regardless of the altogether different atmosphere, attitudes, mores, responses of the Indian society, and its profile. The identities of the two worlds are different. The solution of problems cannot therefore be identical.........."" This Court went on to observe at page 225: "".........Without the fear of making too wide a statement, or of overstating the case, it can be said that rarely will a girl or a woman in India make false allegations of sexual assault on account of any such factor as has been just enlisted. The statement is generally true in the context of the urban as also rural society. It is also by and large true in the context of the sophisticated, not so sophisticated, and unsophisticated society. Only very rarely can one conceivably come across an exception or two and that too possibly from amongst the urban elites. Because (1) A girl or a woman in the tradition- bound non-permissive society of India would be extremely reluctant even to admit that any incident which is likely to reflect on her chastity had ever occurred. (2) She would be conscious of the danger of being ostracized by the society or being looked down by the society including by her own family members, relatives, friends, and neighbours. (3) She would have to brave the whole world. (4) She would face the risk of losing the love and respect of her own husband and near relatives, and of her matrimonial home and happiness being shattered. (5) If she is unmarried, she would apprehend that it would be 22 difficult to secure an alliance with a suitable match from a respectable or an acceptable family. (6) It would almost inevitably and almost invariably result in mental torture and suffering to herself. (7) The fear of being taunted by others will always haunt her. (8) She would feel extremely embarassed in relating the incident to others being overpowered by a feeling of shame on account of the upbringing in a tradition-bound society where by and large sex is taboo. (9) The natural inclination would be to avoid giving publicity to the incident lest the family name and family honour is brought into controversy. (10) The parents of an unmarried girl as also the husband and members of the husband's family of a married woman, would also more often than not, want to avoid publicity on account of the fear of social stigma on the family name and family honour. (11) The fear of the victim herself being considered to be promiscuous or in some way responsible for the incident regardless of her innocence. (12) The reluctance to face interrogation by the investigating agency, to face the court, to face the cross-examination by counsel for the culprit, and the risk of being disbelieved, acts as a deterrent."" 23. We shall now examine the evidence of the prosecutrix. The prosecutrix at the relevant time was less than 18 years of age. She was removed from the lawful custody of her brother in the evening on September 19, 1989. She was taken to a different village by two adult males under threat and kept in a rented room for many days where A-1 had forcible sexual intercourse with her. Whenever she asked A-1 for 23 return to her village, she was threatened and her mouth was gagged. Although we find that there are certain contradictions and omissions in her testimony, but such omissions and contradictions are minor and on material aspects, her evidence is consistent. The prosecutrix being illiterate and rustic young woman, some contradictions and omissions are natural as her recollection, observance, memory and narration of chain of events may not be precise. Learned counsel for the respondent submitted that no alarm was raised by the prosecutrix at the bus stand or the other places where she was taken and that creates serious doubt about truthfulness of her evidence. This argument of the learned counsel overlooks the situation in which the prosecutrix was placed. She had been kidnapped by two adult males, one of them - A-1 - wielded fire- arm and threatened her and she was taken away from her village. In the circumstances, it made sensible decision not to raise alarm. Any alarm at unknown place might have endangered her life. The absence of alarm by her at the public place cannot lead to an inference that she had willingly accompanied A-1 and A-2. The circumstances made her 24 submissive victim and that does not mean that she was inclined and willing to intercourse with A-1. She had no free act of the mind during her stay with A-1 as she was under constant fear. 24. We have also examined the evidence of prosecutrix, her brother and the statement of A-1 under Section 313 Cr.P.C. to satisfy ourselves whether there was likelihood of false implication or motive for false accusations. Except the bald statement of A-1 under Section 313 Cr.P.C. that he has been falsely implicated due to enmity, nothing has been brought on record that may probabalise that the prosecutrix had motive to falsely implicate him. The circumstances even do not remotely suggest that the prosecutrix would put her reputation and chastity at stake for the reason stated by A-1 in the statement under Section 313 Cr.P.C. that a case was pending between A-1 and one Sheo Ratan. In our view, the evidence of the prosecutrix is reliable and has rightly been acted upon by the trial court. 25. Although the lady doctor - PW-5 did not find any injury on the external or internal part of body of the prosecutrix and opined that the prosecutrix was habitual to sexual 25 intercourse, we are afraid that does not make the testimony of the prosecutrix unreliable. The fact of the matter is that the prosecutrix was recovered almost after three weeks. Obviously the sign of forcible intercourse would not persist for that long period. It is wrong to assume that in all cases of intercourse with the women against will or without consent, there would be some injury on the external or internal part of the victim. The prosecutrix has clearly deposed that she was not in a position to put up any struggle as she was taken away from her village by two adult males. The absence of injuries on the person of the prosecutrix is not sufficient to discredit her evidence; she was a helpless victim. She did not and could not inform the neighbours where she was kept due to fear. 26. As regards the belated FIR, suffice it to observe that PW-1 (brother of the prosecutrix) has given plausible explanation. PW-1 deposed that when he returned to his home in the evening from agricultural field, he was informed that her sister (prosecutrix) who had gone to ease herself had not returned. He searched his sister and he was told by the two villagers that her sister was seen with the accused. He 26 contacted the relatives of the accused for return of his sister. He did not lodge the report immediately as the honour of the family was involved. It was only after few days that when his sister did not return and there was no help from the relatives of the accused that he made the complaint on September 28, 1989 to the Superintendent of Police, Hardoi who marked the complaint to the Circle Officer and the FIR was registered on September 30, 1989. The delay in registration of the FIR is, thus, reasonably explained. The High Court was in grave error in concluding that there was no reasonable and plausible explanation for the belated FIR and that it was lodged after consultation and due deliberation and that creates doubt about the case. Unfortunately, the High Court did not advert to the evidence of PW-1 and the reasoning of the trial court in this regard. 27. The High Court was not at all justified in taking a different view or conclusion from the trial court. The judgment of the High Court is vitiated by non-consideration of the material evidence and relevant factors eloquently emerging from the prosecution evidence. The High Court in a sketchy manner 27 reversed the judgment of the trial court without discussing the deposition of the witnesses as well as all relevant points which were considered and touched upon by the trial court. We are satisfied that the judgment of the High Court cannot be sustained and has to be set aside. 28. We are not oblivious of the fact that the incident is of 1989; the prosecutrix has married after the incident and A-1 has a family of his own and sending A-1 to jail now may disturb his family life. But none of these factors individually or collectively persuades us for a soft option. Rape is a heinous crime and once it is established against a person charged of the offence, justice must be done to the victim of crime by awarding suitable punishment to the crime doer. We are constrained to observe that criminal justice system is not working in our country as it should. The police reforms have not taken place despite directions of this Court in the case of Prakash Singh & Ors. vs. Union of India & Ors.9 . We do not intend to say anything more in this regard since matter is being dealt with separately by a 3-Judge Bench. The investigators hardly have professional orientation; they do not have modern 9 (2006) 8 SCC1 28 tools. On many occasions impartial investigation suffers because of political interference. The criminal trials are protracted because of non-appearance of official witnesses on time and the non-availability of the facilities for recording evidence by video conferencing. The public prosecutors have their limitations; the defence lawyers do not make themselves available and the court would be routinely informed about their pre-occupation with other matters; the courts remain over- burdened with the briefs listed on the day and they do not have adequate infrastructure. The adjournments thus become routine; the casualty is justice. It is imperative that the criminal cases relating to offences against the State, corruption, dowry death, domestic violence, sexual assault, financial fraud and cyber crimes are fast tracked and decided in a fixed time frame, preferably, of three years including the appeal provisions. It is high time that immediate and urgent steps are taken in amending the procedural and other laws to achieve the above objectives. We must remember that a strong and efficient criminal justice system is a guarantee to the rule of law and vibrant civil society. 29 29. The appeal is, accordingly, allowed and the judgment of acquittal passed by the High Court of Judicature at Allahabad, Lucknow Bench, in Criminal Appeal No. 484 of 1990 is set aside. The judgment passed by the III Additional Sessions Judge, Hardoi is restored. The respondent shall now surrender within two months from today to serve out the remaining sentence as awarded by the trial court. .......... .............. J. (Aftab Alam) ........................

Supreme Court of India Sushila Digambar Naik & Ors vs Maharashtra Housing & Ar.Dev.Authy& ... on 14 January, 2011 Bench: A.K. Patnaik , R.V. Raveendran IN THE SUPREME COURT OF INDIA CIVIL APPELLATE JURISDICTION CIVIL APPEAL NO. 565 OF 2011 [Arising out of SLP(C) No.10634/2010] SUSHILA DIGAMBAR NAIK & ORS. .......APPELLANTS Vs. MAHARASHTRA HOUSING & AREA .....RESPONDENTS DEVELOPMENT AUTHORITY & ORS. O R D E R Leave granted. Heard. 2. The members of the fourth respondent-Society decided to redevelop the property - Building No.34,Ganesh-Kripa Co- operative Housing Society Ltd., Kher Nagar, Bandra (East) Mumbai, by demolishing the existing building through a developer (fifth respondent) in the year 2003. An agreement dated 17.6.2003 was entered between the Society and the developer in that behalf. It is stated that, at that stage, 9 out of the 54 members had opposed the development through the fifth respondent. 3. Under the said agreement, the developer had agreed to provide each member/occupant, a flat with a carpet area of 345 sq. feet and a balcony/dry area of 70 sq.ft. On 9.1.2004, the first respondent (MHADA) issued a NOC for redevelopment to MHADA. However, subsequently, the appellants herein, who are 18 in number (referred to as non- co-operating members of the Society comprising the original nine plus addition nine members), opposed the development through fifth respondent. That led to the developer (fifth respondent) filing a suit against the appellants for a permanent injunction to restrain them from interfering with the development. In the said suit an interim injunction was issued against the appellants. 4. Except the appellants, the other members of the fourth respondent-Society vacated the premises and shifted to transit accommodation provided by the developer (or received an agreed sum as rent in lieu of transit accommodation). The appellants did not vacate the premises. Therefore MHADA passed an order of summary eviction against them under Section 95A of the Maharashtra Housing and Area Development Act, 1976. That order was challenged by the appellants in Writ Petition (Lodging) 10/2010. The writ petition was dismissed by a learned single Judge, by order dated 4.2.2010. The writ appeal filed by the appellants was also dismissed by the impugned order dated 12.3.2010. The said order is challenged by the appellants in this appeal by special leave. 5. The permissible FSI has been increased considerably subsequent to the agreement between the fourth respondent- Society and the fifth respondent-developer. In view of the above and to put an end to the litigation, Mr. Mukul Rohtagi, learned senior counsel for the fifth respondent- developer on instructions from Mr. Yogesh Gupta, the Executive Director of fifth respondent, who is present in Court, offered that instead of 345 sq. feet carpet area and 70 sq. feet dry area originally agreed, the fifth respondent will construct and make available to each of the 54 members of the fourth respondent-Society, including the appellants, a flat measuring 525 sq. feet (carpet area) and 116 sq. feet (dry area) subject to the following conditions: (i) All appellants shall vacate and deliver vacant possession of their respective portions to the developer within six weeks from today. (ii) The Developer will construct and deliver the flats to all the 54 members within thirty months from the expiry of the said six weeks. (iii) If there is any delay in delivering the flats to the 54 members (that is, within thirty months plus six weeks), the Developer will pay a compensation of Rs.5,000/- (Rupees five thousand) per month to each of the 54 members of the Society [in addition to the transit accommodation/rent-in- lieu thereof (opted by some members) to which the members are entitled]. (iv) The corpus amount agreed will continue to be the same. 6. Mr. Shekhar Naphade, learned senior counsel for the appellants, on instructions, submits that in view of the better terms now offered by the Developer, the appellants are agreeable to join the other members of the Society in regard to the development of the property. The learned counsel for the fourth respondent-Society submitted that the Society was agreeable for the revised benefits. Thus all 54 members of the Society have agreed for the revised benefits offered by the developer. The said settlement between the appellants, fourth respondent and the fifth respondent is recorded. 7. Learned counsel appearing for respondents 1 to 3 submit that as this is a voluntary arrangement between the fourth respondent and its members with the fifth respondent. MHADA has no comments to offer or no role in the settlement. 8. All parties submitted that the appeal may be disposed of accordingly. In view of the above, recording the said settlement, this appeal is disposed of. Each of the appellants, the Society and the developer will be entitled to enforce the above, as a decree, in the event of default/breach by the other parties to the settlement. ....................J.

Dave , Mukundakam Sharma 1 REPORTABLE IN THE SUPREME COURT OF INDIA CIVIL APPELLATE JURISDICTION CIVIL APPEAL NO. 1042 OF 2011 [Arising out of SLP (C) No. 35813 of 2009] HARI RAM ....Appellant Versus JYOTI PRASAD & ANR. ... Respondents JUDGMENT Dr. MUKUNDAKAM SHARMA, J. 1. Leave granted. 2. By this judgment and order, we propose to dispose of the aforesaid appeal which is filed by the appellant herein after being aggrieved by the judgment and order passed by the High Court 2 in RSA No. 2698 of 2008 affirming the judgment and decree passed by the trial Court in Civil Suit No. 160 of 2003 which was affirmed by the First Appellate Court in Civil Appeal No. 92 of 2007. These facts, therefore, make it crystal clear that the present appeal is directed against the concurrent findings of fact of the High Court, the first Appellate Court i.e. the judgment of the Additional District Judge and the trial court which was the Court of Civil Judge (Junior Division). 3. In order to appreciate the contentions raised before us by the learned counsel appearing for the appellant, it would be necessary to set out certain basic facts leading to filing of the present appeal. 4. The suit was filed by the respondent herein contending inter alia that all the six persons including respondent No. 1 have their common interest in the disputed street alongwith co- inhabitants of the same area. It was stated that the residential 3 houses of the respondents are falling in the site plan which indicates that there is a common street for ingress and egress of the general public. It was alleged in the plaint that earlier Bal Kishan Dass who was examined as PW-4 was the original owner of the entire area out of which he curved out a colony selling plots in favour of various parties. It was also stated in the plaint that at that time itself a 10 feet wide public street was left on the ground as detailed in the site plan for the common use of all the plot holders of the colony, but further allegation was that the appellant/defendant from the time of possession of his plot had evil eye on the aforesaid disputed street and the defendant No. 1 and he namely defendant No. 2 encroached upon substantial part of the same making the street narrowed down causing inconvenience to the users of the said street. Incidentally the suit was filed invoking Order I Rule 8 of Code of Civil Procedure [called in short ` C.P.C .']. 4 5. In the plaint it was further stated that earlier the respondent No. 1 as complainant filed a complaint under Section 133 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 (for short ""the Cr.P.C ."") which was decided in favour of the plaintiff/respondent No. 1 and the said judgment was passed by the SDM. 6. When the matter was challenged before the Punjab and Haryana High Court, the High Court held that the matter which is agitated relates to disputed facts and therefore requires evidence and that the dispute between the parties could only be effectively decided if a civil suit is filed. As the High Court had held that the dispute between the parties would be decided by filing a civil suit, consequently the aforesaid plaint was filed in the Court of Civil Judge (Junior Division) which was registered as Civil Suit No. 160 of 2003. 5 7. Defendant Nos. 1 and the present appellant as defendant No. 2 filed a combined written statement raising objections regarding the maintainability of the suit and also with regard to the merit of the contentions raised in the plaint. On the basis of the pleadings of the parties, four issues were framed by the trial court to the following effect: 1. Whether the defendants have made illegal / unauthorized construction over the public street by way of illegal encroachment as shown in red colour in the attached site plan shown by letters ABCD situated at village Matlauda, Distt. Panipat ? OPP. 2.In case issue No. 1 is decided in favour of plaintiff, then whether plaintiff is also entitled to injunction, as prayed for? OPP. 3.Whether suit filed by the plaintiff is not maintainable in the present form? OPD. 4.Relief. 8. To substantiate his case, the plaintiff/respondent No. 1 6 examined 8 witnesses and produced some documents whereas the present appellant as defendant No. 2 examined himself as DW-1 as a sole witness. After recording the evidence adduced by the parties the learned Civil Judge (Junior Division) heard the parties and thereafter by a judgment and decree dated 6.12.2007 decreed the suit and a permanent injunction was issued directing the removal of unauthorized construction from the ground as shown in the site plan. Since, the defendant No. 1 had already removed his portion of illegal construction, the present appellant was given one month's time to remove all such constructions failing which respondent No. 1 was given their legal right to get the said construction removed on his own expenses which was allowed to be recovered from the defendants. The defendants were further restrained from raising any further construction in future on the aforesaid 10 feet Rasta as detailed in PW - 7A. 7 9. Being aggrieved by the aforesaid judgment and order passed by the trial court, an appeal was filed before the Additional District Judge, Panipat whereas the appeal was registered as Civil Appeal No. 92 of 2007. The aforesaid appeal was heard by the Additional District Judge who by his judgment and decree dated 25.7.2008 dismissed the appeal filed by the appellant. Thereafter, the appellant filed a second appeal before the Punjab and Haryana High Court which was registered as RSA No. 2698 of 2008. 10. By a judgment and decree dated 31.7.2009, the aforesaid appeal was also dismissed by the High Court holding that there is no specific question of law involved in the aforesaid appeal. 11. Being still aggrieved, the present appeal was filed by the appellant herein in which notice was issued and on service thereof, we heard the learned counsel appearing for the parties. 8 12. Mr. Anoop G. Choudhary, learned Senior Counsel appearing for the appellant very forcefully argued that none of the judgments and decrees passed by the courts below is justified. He submitted that the suit itself was barred by limitation but despite the said fact and despite the fact that a specific stand was taken in the written statement contending that the suit is barred by limitation, no such issue was framed by the trial Court and no decision was rendered by the trial court as also by the appellate Court on the said issue and that the High Court was not justified in dismissing the plea raised by the appellant on the ground that the cause of action is a continuing cause of action and, therefore, it cannot be said that the suit is barred by limitation. His second contention was that there could and should have been no finding regarding the encroachment made by the appellant in absence of production of any official document to indicate that there was in fact a public street used by the residents of the area. He 9 submitted that no evidence has been led to prove and establish that it was a public street on which encroachment was made by the appellant. His last submission was that the suit was said to be in representative capacity as shown in the plaint but the formalities for instituting a case i.e. representative suit was not followed and therefore the suit should have been dismissed at the very threshold itself. 13. The aforesaid submissions of the learned senior counsel appearing for the appellant were refuted by the learned counsel appearing for the respondents who placed before us the findings recorded by the three courts below and relying on the same, it was submitted that the present appeal has no merit at all. 14. In the light of the aforesaid submissions of the counsel appearing for the parties, we also perused the records very 10 carefully. We would first deal with the plea of limitation as raised before us by the appellant. 15. The records placed before us do disclose that the appellant in his written statement took up a plea that the suit is barred by limitation. However, despite the said fact no issue was framed nor any grievance was made by the appellant for non-framing of an issue of limitation. 16. On going through the records, we do not find that the appellant has made any submission before the trial court as also before the first appellate court regarding the plea of limitation. Such a plea is seen to have been made before the High Court. The said plea which was made before the High Court was considered at length by the High Court and the High Court held that although such a plea was not raised either before the trial court or before the appellate court, the same could be raised before the High Court in 11 view of the provisions of Section 3 of the Limitation Act which places an obligation upon the Court to discuss and consider such a plea despite the fact that no such plea was raised and argued before the Trial Court as also before the First Appellate Court. 17. The High Court after considering the aforesaid plea held that the suit cannot be said to be barred by limitation as an encroachment on a public street is a continuing wrong and therefore, there exists a continuing cause of action. The records disclose that initially a complaint under Section 133 of Cr.PC was filed which was pursued with all sincerity upto the High Court. But the High Court held that the dispute between the parties could be better resolved if a proper civil suit is filed and when evidence is led with regard to the disputed questions of fact. We find from the records that immediately thereafter the aforesaid suit was filed seeking issuance of a mandatory 12 injunction. In view of the aforesaid facts and also in view of the fact that encroachment on a public street by any person is a continuing cause of action, we find no merit in the said contention. 18. Any act of encroachment is a wrong committed by the doer. Such an encroachment when made to a public property like encroachment to public road would be a graver wrong, as such wrong prejudicially affects a number of people and therefore is a public wrong. So long any obstruction or obstacle is created to free and unhindered access and movement in the road, the wrongful act continues thereby preventing the persons to use the public road freely and unhindered. Therefore, that being a continuing source of wrong and injury, cause of action is created as long as such injury continues and as long as the doer is responsible for causing such injury. 13 19. At this stage it would be apposite to refer to and rely upon Section 22 of the Limitation Act, 1963, which reads as follows: ""In case of a continuing breach of contract or in case of a continuing tort, a fresh period of limitation begins to run at every moment of the time during which the breach or the tort, as the case may be, continues."" This court had the occasion to deal with Section 22 of the Limitation Act, 1963, in the case of Sankar Dastidar v. Shrimati Banjula Dastidar and Anr reported in AIR 2007 SC 514, in which the Supreme Court held that when a right of way is claimed whether public or private over a certain land over which the tort-feaser has no right of possession, the breaches would be continuing, to which the provisions of Section 22 of the Limitation Act, 1963, would apply. Therefore, in our considered opinion the plea that the suit is barred by limitation has no merit at all. 14 20. The next plea which was raised and argued vehemently by the learned senior counsel appearing for the appellant was that the suit was bad for non-compliance of the provisions of Order I Rule 8 of the CPC . The said submission is also found to be without any merit as apart from being a representative suit, the suit was filed by an aggrieved person whose right to use public street of 10 feet width was prejudicially affected. Since affected person himself has filed a suit, therefore, the suit cannot be dismissed on the ground of alleged non-compliance of the provisions of Order I Rule 8 of the CPC . 21. In this connection, we may appropriately refer to a judgment of the Supreme in Kalyan Singh, London Trained Cutter, Johri Bazar, Jaipur Vs. Smt. Chhoti and Ors. reported in AIR 1990 SC 396. In paragraph 13 of the said judgment , this Court has held that suit could be instituted by representative of a particular 15 community but that by itself was not sufficient to constitute the suit as representative suit inasmuch as for a representative suit, the permission of Court under Order I Rule 8 of the CPC is mandatory. 22. In paragraph 14 of the said judgment , it was also held that any member of a community may successfully bring a suit to assert his right in the community property or for protecting such property by seeking removal of encroachment therefrom and that in such a suit he need not comply with the requirements of Order I Rule 8 CPC . It was further held in the said case that the suit against alleged trespass even if it was not a representative suit on behalf of the community could be a suit of this category. 16 23. In that view of the matter and in the light of the aforesaid legal position laid down by this Court, we hold that the suit filed by the plaintiff/respondent No. 1 was maintainable. 24. According to the appellant no official document was placed and no official witness was examined to prove and establish that the suit land was a public street in which encroachment is made by the appellant. At this stage it would be appropriate to mention that the suit was initially instituted against two defendants namely defendant No. 1 and defendant No. 2. The appellant herein was defendant No. 2 in the said suit. So far as defendant No. 1 is concerned, the records disclose that the Panchayat of the area took a decision that both of them have encroached upon a public property and the street and therefore they should remove the encroachment. It is disclosed from the records that pursuant to the aforesaid decision of the Panchayat, the defendant No. 1 removed his encroachment after 17 admitting that he had also encroached upon some area of the 10 feet wide street which fact he admitted before the panchayat and later on he removed the said encroachment. The aforesaid fact is established from the statements of PW-1. Jyoti Parshad, PW-5 - Sadhu Ram and PW-6 - Ram Pal who were present and participated in the said Panchayat also corroborated the said admission before the Panchayat. 25. Besides, in all 8 witnesses were examined by the plaintiff respondent No. 1. PW-3, Dharam Singh Patwari who was examined in the suit proved the report of the BDO who had visited the disputed property on 18.1.1995 after which he also submitted a report certifying that an encroachment has been made by the appellant over the disputed street. Bal Kishan Dass who was also examined as PW-4 had specifically stated in his evidence that he had carved out a colony in the year 1981-82 and he had sold the plots to the plaintiff as well as defendants and other inhabitants of the 18 village and towards eastern side of the plot of the defendant/appellant he had left a street of 10 feet width. 26. As against the aforesaid evidence adduced on behalf of the plaintiff/respondent No. 1, the appellant examined himself as DW-1 wherein he only took a stand that disputed property is not a part of the street and that after purchasing the plot he had constructed the house and despite the said fact no objection was taken and therefore it cannot be said that he had constructed a house also on a part of the said disputed suit property. 27. On appreciation of the aforesaid evidence, all the three courts namely the High Court, the First Appellate Court as also the trial court held that the aforesaid disputed suit land is a part of the public street where the appellant has encroached upon by constructing a part of the house. The aforesaid findings are 19 therefore findings of fact. Public Officer namely Patwari was examined who had proved the report submitted by the BDO stating that part of the suit property is a public street. 28. Ext. PW-7A filed by the plaintiff/respondent is a site plan which proves and establishes that there is a public street of 10 feet width. In all the sale deeds of the area as disclosed from the statement of PW-4 Bal Kishan Dass, the aforesaid street of 10 feet width is shown and the aforesaid evidence go unrebutted. Thus there exists a street of 10 feet width. It is also proved from the evidence on record that the appellant has encroached upon the suit property consisting of the aforesaid street of 10 feet width. That being the position, we find no infirmity in the judgment and decree passed by the Trial Court and affirmed by the First Appellate Court and by the High Court in the Second Appeal. 20 29. We, therefore, find no merit in this appeal which is dismissed with costs, which is assessed by us at Rs. 10,000/-. The decree passed by the trial court is confirmed. If the appellant fails to vacate and remove the unauthorized encroachment within a period of 60 days from today, it will be open for the plaintiff/respondent No. 1 to get the decree executed in accordance with law. 30.

This criminal appeal has been preferred against the judgment and order of the Punjab and Haryana High Court at Chandigarh dated 5th May, 2004 in Criminal Appeal No. 708-SB of 1998, by which the conviction of the appellant by Additional Sessions Judge, Gurgaon, vide judgment and order dated 22nd August, 1998 and 25th August, 1998 for offences under Sections 498-A , 304-B and 306 of Indian Penal Code, 1860 (hereinafter referred as ` IPC ') and awarding the sentence to undergo rigorous imprisonment for two years and to pay a fine of Rs. 500/- and in default of payment of fine to further undergo 1 rigorous imprisonment for two months, has been upheld. However, for the offence under Section 304-B IPC sentence to undergo for ten years and pay a fine of Rs.2,000/- in default of payment of fine, to further undergo rigorous imprisonment for six months, has been reduced to seven years with fine. 2. Facts and circumstances giving rise to this case are that the appellant was married to Sarla (deceased) on 4th April, 1988. An FIR was lodged by Shyam Lal (PW.4) father of Sarla (deceased) on 25th June, 1991 making allegations that the appellant, his mother, brother and sister-in-law had consistently harassed his daughter Sarla (deceased) by making dowry demand i.e. a scooter. She had been maltreated by them. After one year of marriage, Sarla (deceased) came and stayed with her family for about 14 months. It was only after convening a panchayat of close relatives, she had returned to her matrimonial home. Again they maltreated and insisted for the demand of a scooter, thus, she had been subjected to cruelty, harassment by demand of dowry to the extent that she committed suicide on 25th June, 1991, at her matrimonial home. 2 3. After investigation of the case, the prosecution filed the chargesheet against the appellant and his mother Smt. Shanti Devi and charges were framed against them under Sections 498-A , 304-B and 306 IPC. The said two accused pleaded not guilty, thus, they were put on trial. It was on 17th May, 1995, that in view of the evidence of the prosecution witnesses, the learned Sessions Judge in exercise of his power under Section 319 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 (hereinafter called Cr.P.C .) summoned the other two accused Ashok Kumar, brother and Smt. Shakuntala, sister-in-law of the appellant and charges were reframed against all the four accused under Sections 498-A , 304-B and 306 IPC vide order dated 6th July, 1995. 4. In order to substantiate its case, the prosecution examined several witnesses including complainant Shyam Lal (PW.4), Gulshan (PW.5), brother of Sarla (deceased), Dr. B.B. Agarwal (PW.1), Shri Arjun Singh Yadav, ASI, (PW.6), Constable Jai Pal (PW.2), Shri Mool Chand Punia, Draftsman (PW.3), and other formal witnesses. 5. While making their statement under Section 313 Cr.P.C., the accused persons denied all the allegations against them and set up the defence as under: 3 ""Sarla was in love with some other person. She was forced to marry with accused Bansi Lal against her will, due to which she felt suffocated and committed suicide, leaving a suicide note to that effect. There was no demand of Scooter."" Further, accused Ashok Kumar (A.3) and Shakuntala (A.4) pleaded that they had been living separately from the appellant and his mother and they had no involvement so far as the demand of dowry was concerned. In defence only three witnesses i.e. Bal Kishan, an official of HSEB (DW.1), Vidya Nand, an Inspector of Food and Supplies Department (DW.2) and Surender Singh, Sarpanch of the village Gram Panchayat (DW.3) were examined only to prove that accused Ashok Kumar (A.3) and Shakuntala (A.4) were living separately from the appellant and his mother Smt. Shanti Devi. 6. After considering the entire evidence on record and the submissions made by the prosecution as well as defence, the trial court convicted the appellant and his mother Smt. Shanti Devi under Sections 498-A , 304-B and 306 IPC and awarded the sentences as referred to hereinabove. The court acquitted Ashok Kumar and Shakuntala of all the charges against them. The Trial Court did not award any separate sentence under Section 306 IPC. 4 7. Being aggrieved, the appellant and his mother Smt. Shanti Devi preferred Criminal Appeal No. 708-SB of 1998 which has been disposed of by the impugned judgment and order dated 5th May, 2004, acquitting Smt. Shanti Devi, not being beneficiary of the demand of dowry, as only scooter had been demanded but dismissed the appeal so far as the present appellant is concerned. However, considering the facts and circumstances of the case, the sentence under Section 304-B IPC has been reduced from 10 years to 7 years. Hence, this appeal. 8. Shri Mahabir Singh, learned senior counsel appearing for the appellant, has submitted that no charge could be brought home against the appellant under any of the penal provisions as there was no demand of dowry by the appellant. The harassment was not in close proximity of time of death. The prosecution itself had submitted that Sarla (deceased) wanted to marry one Shiv Parkash Singh and thus, she was not happy with the appellant. She had left a suicide note to that effect and the said note had been exhibited before the trial court as Ex.P2. Thus, the appeal deserves to be allowed. 9. On the contrary, Shri Rao Ranjit, learned advocate appearing for the State, has vehemently opposed the appeal contending that the 5 facts and circumstances of the case do not warrant interference with the concurrent finding of facts recorded by the courts below. The suicide note Ex.P2 has to be ignored as it has not been proved as per requirement of law. No witness has been examined for comparing the handwriting of the deceased nor it has been signed by the deceased. It had not even been shown to father of the deceased i.e. Shyam Lal (PW.4), complainant or her brother Gulshan (PW.5). More so, it had been the defence of the appellant while making his statement under Section 313 Cr.P.C. Thus, he should have led evidence to substantiate the defence. Thus, the appeal lacks merit and is liable to dismissed. 10. We have considered the rival submissions made by the learned counsel for the parties and perused the material on record. The admitted facts of the case remain as under: (i) There was no demand of scooter at the initial stage of marriage in 1988. (ii) Complainant Shyam Lal (PW.4) and Gulshan (PW.5) had deposed that there had been consistent and persistent demand of scooter by the appellant. 6 (iii) After one year of the marriage, when Sarla (deceased) came to the house of her parents, she stayed with them for a period of 14 months. (iv) During this period of 14 months, no attempt had been made by the appellant to call her newly wedded wife back to the matrimonial home. (v) A Panchayat of very close relatives was convened and they had assured the parents and family members of Sarla (deceased) that appellant and his other family members would behave properly with Sarla (deceased) and she would not be maltreated or humiliated or subjected to any kind of cruelty for demand of dowry. (vi) It was on this assurance that Sarla (deceased) came back to stay with the appellant at her matrimonial home. (vii) Sarla committed suicide by hanging herself on 25th June, 1991. (viii) The appellant or any of his family members did not inform Shyam Lal, (PW.4), complainant or any of his family members about the death of Sarla (deceased). 7 (ix) Shyam Lal (PW.4) and Gulshan (PW.5) reached her matrimonial home alongwith others getting information from other persons. (x) Shyam Lal (PW.4) immediately lodged the FIR against the appellant and other family members and, set the law in motion. (xi) Sarla (deceased) was found dead at her matrimonial home when she stayed with the appellant and other family members. They had not furnished any satisfactory explanation as for which reason and under what circumstances she had committed suicide. 11. So far as the theory of love affair of Sarla (deceased) is concerned, it has been disbelieved by the courts below. The Trial Court dealt with the issued observing as under : ""If the husband was doubting her fidelity towards him there was no reason for him to have come with his father and other relatives to the parents of the deceased to take her back after 14 months of her stay with her parents. It also cannot be said that the deceased was not having any liking for her husband and was frustrated because she allegedly could not marry the person of her choice. Rather the circumstances are otherwise. Had she developed hatred for her husband, there was no 8 reason for her to join him after 14 months of her staying away from the matrimonial home. There was every reason for her to believe the husband and his relatives that demand of dowry and other torture and maltreatment would not be there. Better sense definitely, after such a lapse of time, was naturally to be expected to have dawned on them. Parents of the deceased also did not create any hassles as they felt satisfied from the assurance of the accused on this score. At any rate melodramatic story of her love affairs with some one and her frustration in her married life with accused Bansi Lal can hardly be taken as genuine. If it was so, she could not have continued to wait to die for her alleged lover for three long years, having consummated the marriage with her husband and having cohabited with him all- through she was with him in the matrimonial home."" 12. Again, the High Court has dealt with the issue elaborately and recorded the following findings: ""Much has been said by the learned counsel about Ex.P-2, the note allegedly recovered by the Investigating Officer. In my considered view, this document has to be totally rejected from consideration in evidence for the simple reason that no nexus of the deceased has been established with this document. There is no evidence worth the name from the side of the prosecution or from the defence, which may indicate that the writing Ex.P-2 was, in fact, in the hand of Sarla deceased. Shyam Lal and Gulshan PWs when stepped into the witness-box do not say even a word that the document Ex.P-2 is written in the hand of Sarla deceased. Even the defence counsel did not put 9 any specific question/suggestion to these witnesses about authorship of this document, knowing very well that ASI Arjun Singh Yadav, Investigating Officer had taken it into possession from the almirah of their house. The Investigating Officer (PW6) in his cross examination has stated that the diary, letter and ball-pen were lying in the room and he enquired about the author of the said letter Ex.P-2 and it was revealed that the same was written by the deceased. This statement can be termed as a hear say evidence, having no legal sanctity when the main witnesses were not asked about the authorship thereof. A mere suggestion put to Shyam Lal and Gulshan PWs to the effect that Sarla had left a suicide note regarding her relations with some other person, takes us no where. The authorship of this letter could be proved either by producing some witness who had seen the deceased writing and signing or the said document could be sent to some handwriting expert alongwith the admitted writing of Sarla deceased for comparison. Both the situations are missing. Even the Investigating Officer does not say a word as to from whom he had verified about authorship of the said letter. In case this document is taken to be a proved one, this would amount to bye-passing the provisions of the Evidence Act . The Investigating Officer cannot be all and all. The irresistible conclusion, thus, is that the document Ex.P-2, the so-called suicide note has to be taken out of the zone of consideration. The defence of the Bansi Lal appellant thus becomes very weak and fragile."" 13. In view of the above, we do not see any cogent reason to take a view contrary to the view taken by the courts below that Ex.P2, the 1 suicide note was not worth consideration. It has rightly been held by the courts below that it was to be ignored. Ext.P.2, the so-called suicide note disclosing that Sarla (deceased) committed suicide as she developed love affair with Shiv Parkash has been referred to by the Investigating Officer Arjun Singh, ASI (PW.6) where in his cross-examination he has stated as under:- ""The diary, letter, and ball pen were lying in a window of the room. He had enquired about the author of the letter Ext.P.2 and it was revealed that it is written by Sarla, deceased."" The witnesses of panchnama of recovery of this letter had not been examined though they had been Mahabir Singh, Chowkidar of village Shiwari and Hoshiar Singh, Ex. Sarpanch of Shiwari. Shyam Lal (PW.4) and Gulshan (PW.5) both have denied the suggestion of recovery of any such letter nor the letters had been shown to them for identifying the handwriting of Sarla (deceased). More so, there is nothing on record to show that she was educated. Arjun Singh, ASI (PW.6) has not stated anywhere that he knew the handwriting of Sarla (deceased) nor he has disclosed on whose information he had inferred that the letter had been written by Sarla (deceased). In such a fact situation, the recovery of such letter is to be disbelieved and the letter 1 is required to be ignored totally. More so, it has no probative value because it is no body's case that the alleged suicide note is in the handwriting of Sarla (deceased). 14. The demand of scooter had been consistent and persistent as Shyam Lal (PW.4) and Gulshan (PW.5) had specifically deposed that the demand was only in respect of scooter and nothing else. Had this allegation be false, the said witnesses could also mention other articles purported to have been demanded by the appellant or his other family members. Therefore, the veracity of the evidence of these two witnesses on this issue cannot be doubted. Both the witnesses had been subjected to long cross examination at the behest of the appellant, however, nothing could be elicited from them to the extent that the allegations made by the prosecution could be false. 15. While considering the case under Section 498-A, cruelty has to be proved during the close proximity of time of death and it should be continuous and such continuous harassment, physical or mental, by the accused should make life of the deceased miserable which may force her to commit suicide. In the instant case, the conduct of the accused forced the deceased Sarla to leave her matrimonial home just 1 after one year of marriage and stay with her parents for 14 months continuously. It was only at the assurance given by the panchayat that the accused or his family members would not humiliate or subject the deceased Sarla with cruelty, that she rejoined her matrimonial home. It is specific evidence of Gulshan (PW.5) that just few days before her death, when he went to see her sister, there was a demand of scooter by the appellant. In such a fact situation, we do not find any force in the submission made on behalf of the appellant that there was no demand of scooter in the close proximity of the death. 16. In such a fact situation, the provisions of Section 113B of the Indian Evidence Act, 1872 providing for presumption that accused is responsible for dowry death, have to be pressed in service. The said provisions read as under:- ""Presumption as to dowry death.--When the question is whether a person has committed the dowry death of a woman and it is shown that soon before her death such woman had been subjected by such person to cruelty or harassment for, or in connection with, any demand for dowry, the court shall presume that such person had caused the dowry death."" (emphasis supplied) 1 It may be mentioned herein that the legislature in its wisdom has used the word ""shall"" thus, making a mandatory application on the part of the court to presume that death had been committed by the person who had subjected her to cruelty or harassment in connection with or demand of dowry. It is unlike the provisions of Section 113A of the Evidence Act where a discretion has been conferred upon the court wherein it had been provided that court may presume to abatement of suicide by a married woman. Therefore, in view of the above, onus lies on the accused to rebut the presumption and in case of Section 113B relatable to Section 304 IPC, the onus to prove shifts exclusively and heavily on the accused. 17. The only requirement is that death of a woman has been caused by means other than any natural circumstances; that death has been caused or occurred within 7 years of her marriage; and such woman had been subjected to cruelty or harassment by her husband or any relative of her husband in connection with any demand of dowry. 18. Therefore, in case the essential ingredients of such death have been established by the prosecution, it is the duty of the court to raise 1 a presumption that the accused has caused the dowry death. It may also be pertinent to mention herein that the expression shown before her death has not been defined in either of the statutes. Therefore, in each case, the court has to analyse the facts and circumstances leading to the death of the victim and decide if there is any proximate connection between the demand of dowry and act of cruelty or harassment and the death. (vide: T. Aruntperunjothi v. State through S.H.O., Pondicherry, AIR 2006 SC 2475; Devi Lal v. State of Rajasthan , AIR 2008 SC 332; State of Rajasthan v. Jaggu Ram , AIR 2008 SC 982; Anand Kumar v. State of M.P. , AIR 2009 SC 2155; and Undavalli Narayana Rao v. State of Andhra Pradesh , AIR 2010 SC 3708). 19. In the instant case, evidently, the suicide note, Ext.P-2 purported to have been written by Sarla (deceased) had been taken by appellant as his defence while making his statement under section 313 Cr.P.C. Therefore, the onus was on him to establish his defence by leading sufficient evidence to rebut the presumption that he has caused the dowry death. The appellant miserably failed to discharge that onus. 1 20. In view of the above, the submissions advanced on behalf of the appellant are rejected. The appeal does not have any special features warranting interference by this court. The appeal lacks merit and stands dismissed. ..................................J. (P.

"Rameshbhai Chandubhai Rathod vs State Of Gujarat on 24 January, 2011","575","Rameshbhai Chandubhai Rathod ......Appellant Vs. The State of Gujarat .......Respondent JUDGMENT HARJIT SINGH BEDI,J. 1. As the facts have been very comprehensively given in the order of Pasayat, J., we will only refer to such facts as are necessary for the disposal of the reference which has been made to us. Suffice it to say that the accused-appellant Rameshbhai Chandubhai Rathod, aged about 28 years, was employed as a watchman in Sanudip Apartments, Rander Road, Surat City. Flat No.A/2 was occupied by the complainant Nareshbhai Thakorebhai Patel, his wife, a son Brijesh, aged 16 years, and the deceased, a daughter, a Class 2 IV student in Ankur School. The accused-appellant was residing with his wife Savita and two children in a one room tenement close by. On the 17th December 1999, the complainant and his wife went to Udhana at about 8.00 p.m. to attend a religious ceremony and on returning therefrom found that their daughter was missing. Frantic enquiries made by the family, bore no result. The complainant thereupon lodged a FIR at 2.30 a.m. on the 18th December 1999 with the Rander Police Station to that effect. The complainant nevertheless continued to search for the child and in due course ascertained from one Bipinbhai Bhandari, one of his friends, who told him that his (Bhandari's) old servant Bishnubhai had told him that he had seen the appellant taking the girl with him on his bicycle. This information was conveyed to the police by the complainant. The police made a search for the appellant but he could not be immediately found but was ultimately located the next day i.e. on the 19th December 1999 by Chandravadan Patel who spotted him sitting in an open space near the vegetable market. The appellant made an extra judicial confession to him that he had 3 raped and killed the child. The police was, accordingly, informed and they took the appellant into custody. The appellant also made a disclosure to the complainant as to the place of incident and the dead body was recovered from that place. On the completion of the investigation, the accused was charged for offences punishable under Sections 363 , 366 , 376 , 302 and 397 of the IPC and brought to trial. The trial court on a minute appreciation of the evidence which was exclusively circumstantial in nature, held that the case against the appellant had been proved beyond doubt, and accordingly convicted him and sentenced him to death for the commission of the offence punishable under section 302 and to various terms of imprisonment for the other offences. The matter was, thereafter, referred to the High Court and the accused also filed an appeal challenging his conviction. The High Court confirmed the reference and dismissed the appeal. The High Court also found that the case against the accused fell within the category of the rarest of the rare cases, as envisaged in Bachan Singh vs. State of Punjab 1980 (2) SCC 684 and Machi Singh vs. State of Punjab 1993 (3) SCC 470 as 4 followed and clarified in a series of other judgments subsequently, particularly, in Dhanonjoy Chatterjee vs. State of West Bengal 1994 (2) SCC 220 and observing that in the balance sheet of the aggravating and mitigating circumstances, the former were pre-dominant, confirmed the death sentence. The judgment of the High Court was challenged by the appellant in this Court and after the grant of special leave, the matter was heard by a Division Bench. The Bench delivered two judgments on the 25th February 2009 and while the two Hon'ble Judges were of the unanimous opinion that the conviction of the appellant was to be maintained, a difference of opinion arose as to the sentence that was to be awarded with Pasayat,J. observing that the case fell within the category of the rarest of rare cases as the deceased was a helpless child of tender age and that the appellant, being a watchman in the building in which she was residing with her parents, was in a position of trust, and as the murder and rape was particularly brutal, the death sentence was the only adequate one. Ganguli, J. however differed on this aspect and held that as there was some 5 uncertainty with the nature of the circumstantial evidence and that the mitigating circumstance particularly the young age of the appellant and the possibility that he could be rehabilitated and would not commit any offence later on, could not be ruled out, and that the statutory obligation cast on the trial court under Section 235 (2) read with Section 354 (3) of the Cr.P.C. had been violated inasmuch that the accused had not been given adequate opportunity to plead on the question of sentence and also citing a large number of cases including those of rape and murder of young children, opined that a sentence of life imprisonment was the proper one. This matter has, accordingly, been referred to us only on the question of the sentence. 2. As already mentioned above, both Hon'ble Judges have relied on a number of cases which are on almost identical facts in support of their respective points of view. We notice that there is a very thin line on facts which separates the award of a capital sentence from a life sentence in the case of rape and murder of a young child by a young man and the subjective opinion of individual Judges as to the morality, 6 efficacy or otherwise of a death sentence cannot entirely be ruled out. It is now well settled that as on today the broad principle is that the death sentence is to be awarded only in exceptional cases. Both Hon'ble Judges have relied extensively on Dhanonjoy Chatterjee 's case (supra). In this case the death sentence had been awarded by the trial court on similar facts and confirmed by the Calcutta High Court and the appeal too dismissed by this Court leading to the execution of the accused. Ganguli,J. has, however, drawn a distinction on the facts of that case and the present one and held that as the appellant was a young man, only 27 years of age, it was obligatory on the trial court to have given a finding as to a possible rehabilitation and reformation and the possibility that he could still become a useful member of society in case he was given a chance to do so. We are, therefore, of the opinion that in the light of the findings recorded by Ganguli,J. it would not be proper to maintain the death sentence on the appellant. At the same time the gravity of the offence, the behaviour of the appellant and the fear and concern such incidents generate in ordered society, cannot be 7 ignored. We, therefore, feel that a via-media ought to be adopted in the light of the judgment of this Court in Ramraj vs. State of Chhattisgarh (2010) 1 SCC 573 and Mulla & Anr. State of Uttar Pradesh (2010) 3 SCC 508. In these two cases, this Court has held that the term imprisonment for life which is found in Section 302 of the IPC, would mean imprisonment for the natural life of the convict subject to the powers of the President and the Governor under Articles 72 and 161 of the Constitution of India or of the State Government under Section 433-A of the Code of Criminal Procedure. In Mulla's case (supra), this Court has said : ""We are in complete agreement with the above dictum of this Court. It is open to the sentencing court to prescribe the length of incarceration. This is especially true in cases where death sentence has been replaced by life imprisonment. The court should be free to determine the length of imprisonment which will suffice the offence committed. Thus we hold that despite the nature of the crime, the mitigating circumstances can allow us to substitute the death penalty with life sentence. Here we would like to note that the punishment of life sentence in this case must extend to their full life, subject to any remission by the Government for good reasons. 8 For the foregoing reasons and taking into account all the aggravating and mitigating circumstances, we confirm the conviction, however, commute the death sentence into that of life imprisonment. The appeal is disposed of accordingly."" In arriving at its conclusion, the Court relied on similar observations made in the case of Ramraj (supra). We are, therefore, of the opinion that the appellant herein ought to be awarded a similar sentence. We accordingly commute the death sentence awarded to him to life but direct that the life sentence must extend to the full life of the appellant but subject to any remission or commutation at the instance of the Government for good and sufficient reasons. 3. As already noticed above, Ganguli, J. has made some observations on the omission of the trial court in dealing with the question of sentence on the principles underlying Section 235 read with Section 354 of the Cr.P.C. We are of the opinion that some of the observations made are a little broad based on the facts of the present case and would present insurmountable practical difficulties for a trial court. Even 9 otherwise the facts indicate that the appellant had been given enough time and opportunity for pleading on the question of sentence. We accordingly dispose of this appeal in the above manner. .....................................J. ( HARJIT SINGH BEDI) .....................................J. ( P.

Supreme Court of India Aruna Ramchandra Shanbaug vs Union Of India & Ors on 24 January, 2011 Equivalent citations: AIRONLINE 2011 SC 343 Bench: Gyan Sudha Misra , Markandey Katju REPORTABLE IN THE SUPREME COURT OF INDIA CIVIL APPELLATE JURISDICTION Writ Petition (Crl.) No.115 OF 2009 Aruna Ramachandra Shanbaug Petitioner(s) VERSUS Union of India & Ors. Respondent(s) OR D E R Heard learned counsel for the petitioner. Euthanasia is one of the most perplexing issues which the courts and legislatures all over the world are facing today. This Court, in this case, is facing the same issue, and we feel like a ship in an unchartered sea, seeking some guidance by the light thrown by the legislations and judicial precedents of foreign countries. The case before us is a writ petition under Article 32 of the Constitution, and has been filed on behalf of the petitioner Aruna Ramachandra Shanbaug by one Ms. Pinki Virani of Mumbai, as a next friend. It is stated in the writ petition that the petitioner Aruna Ramachandra Shanbaug was a staff Nurse working in King Edward Memorial Hospital, Parel, Mumbai. On the evening of 27th November, 1973 she was attacked by a sweeper in the hospital who wrapped a dog chain around her neck and yanked her back with it. He tried to rape her but finding that she was menstruating, he sodomized her. To immobilize her during this act he twisted the chain around her neck. The next day on 28th November, 1973 at 7.45 a.m. a cleaner found her lying on the floor with blood all over in an unconscious condition. It is alleged that due to strangulation by the dog chain the supply of oxygen to the brain stopped and the brain got damaged. It is alleged that the Neurologist in the Hospital found that she had planters' extensor, which means damage to the cortex or some other part of the brain. She also had brain stem contusion injury with associated cervical cord injury. It is alleged at page 11 of the petition that 36 years have expired since the incident and now Aruna Ramachandra Shanbaug is about 60 years of age. She is featherweight, and her brittle bones could break if her hand or leg are awkwardly caught, even accidentally, under her lighter body. She has stopped menstruating and her skin is now like papier mache' stretched over a skeleton. She is prone to bed sores. Her wrists are twisted inwards. Her teeth had decayed causing her immense pain. She can only be given mashed food, on which she survives. It is alleged that Aruna Ramachandra Shanbaug is in a persistent vegetative State and virtually a dead person and has no state of awareness, and her brain is virtually dead. She can neither see, nor hear anything nor can she express herself or communicate, in any manner whatsoever. Mashed food is put in her mouth, she is not able to chew or taste any food. She is not even aware that food has been put in her mouth. She is not able to swallow any liquid food, which shows that the food goes down on its own and not because of any effort on her part. The process of digestion goes on in this way as the mashed food passes through her system. However, Aruna is virtually a skeleton. Her excreta and the urine is discharged on the bed itself. Once in a while she is cleaned up but in a short while again she goes back into the same sub-human condition. Judged by any parameter, Aruna cannot be said to be a living person and it is only on account of mashed food which is put into her mouth there is a fagade of life which is totally devoid of any human element. There is not the slightest possibility of any improvement in her condition and her body lies on the bed in the KEM Hospital, Mumbai like a dead animal, and this has been the position for the last 36 years. The prayer of the petitioner is that the respondents be directed to stop feeding Aruna, and let her die peacefully. Although, notice had been issued by this Court on 16.12.2009 to all the respondents in this petition, the only counter affidavit which has been filed is that on behalf of the respondent no.3 and 4, the Mumbai Municipal Corporation and the Dean, KEM Hospital. That affidavit, of Dr. Amar Ramaji Pazare, Professor and Head in the said hospital, states in paragraph 6 that Aruna accepts the food in normal course and responds by facial expressions. She responds to commands intermittently by making sounds. She makes sounds when she has to pass stool and urine which the nursing staff identifies and attends to by leading her to the toilet. Thus, there is some variance between the allegations in the writ petition and the counter affidavit of Dr. Pazare. In the circumstances we are of the opinion that a team of three doctors should be appointed to examine Aruna Ramachandra Shanbaug thoroughly and give a report to us about her physical and mental condition. For this purpose we are appointing a team of following three doctors : 1) Dr. J.V. Divatia, Professor and Head, Department of Anesthesia, Critical Care and Pain at Tata Memorial Hospital, Mumbai, whose mobile number is 09869077435 and e-mail address is [email protected] 2) Dr. Roop Gursahani, Consultant Neurologist at P.D.

Supreme Court of India U.G.Hospitals P.Ltd vs State Of Haryana & Ors on 19 January, 2011 Bench: A K Patnaik , R V Raveendran 1 IN THE SUPREME COURT OF INDIA CIVIL APPELLATE JURISDICTION CIVIL APPEAL NO.804 OF 2011 [Arising out of SLP [C] No.8419 of 2009] U.G.Hospitals Pvt. Ltd. ... Appellant Vs. State of Haryana & Ors. ... Respondents O R D E R Leave granted. Heard. 2. Haryana Urban Development Authority (`HUDA' for short), the second respondent herein, issued an advertisement in the newspapers dated 14th and 15th June, 2005, inviting applications for allotment of a hospital plot measuring 12 acres in Sector 23A, Gurgaon, and a hospital plot measuring 8.3 Acres in Sector 51, Gurgaon, from persons interested on or before 29.6.2005. In response to the said advertisement, the appellant applied for the hospital plot in Sector 51 on 28.6.2005. The fifth respondent applied on 15.6.2005 (said to have been received by the HUDA on 27.6.2005) for allotment of the hospital plot in Sector 23A, stating that if they were not allotted 2 the plot in Sector 23A, their application may be considered for allotment of the plot in Sector 51. 3. By re-advertisement dated 7.7.2005, the last date for submission of applications was extended upto 20.7.2005 with a clarification that those who had applied earlier in response to the advertisement dated 14/15.6.2005 need not apply again. The fifth respondent gave a letter dated 18.7.2005 to HUDA stating that on physical verification it was found that the plot in Sector 23A was only 8.66 acres and not 12 acres and there was also some difficulties in regard to use of the entire plot for construction and therefore, their application may be considered for allotment of the plot in Sector 51. 4. Both the advertisements required the applicants to apply for allotment in the form prescribed in the advertisements. While the application of fifth respondent dated 15.6.2005 for the plot in Sector 23A was in the prescribed form, the subsequent letter dated 18.7.2005 seeking allotment of the plot in Sector 51 was not an application in the prescribed form, but was only a request letter. After considering the applications, HUDA allotted 3 the plot at Sector 51 to the fifth respondent. The appellant was not allotted any plot. The plot at Sector 23A was not allotted to any one. 5. In pursuance of such allotment, the fifth respondent obtained sanction of a building plan on 25.4.2006 and completed the construction of hospital building in July, 2007. A deed of conveyance dated 19.7.2007 was executed in favour of the fifth respondent in regard to the plot at Sector 51. The fifth respondent's hospital is stated to be functioning in the plot at Sector 51, from 2007 itself. 6. In April, 2007, the appellant filed a writ petition for quashing the allotment letter dated 27.9.2005 issued in favour of the fifth respondent in regard to allotment of the hospital plot at Sector 51 and seeking a direction to the HUDA and the State to allot the said plot at Sector 51 in its favour. Alternatively the appellant prayed that the vacant hospital plot at Sector 23A may be allotted to it. The said writ petition was dismissed by the High Court by impugned order dated 1.12.2008, on the ground that there was considerable delay in filing the writ petition challenging the allotment in favour of the fifth respondent. The High Court also found that there was no 4 irregularity in allotting the plot in Sector 51 to the fifth respondent. It held that the appellant who had participated in the process of allotment without questioning the same, could not challenge the allotment in favour of the fifth respondent. The said order is challenged in this appeal by special leave. 7. The appellant contends that the application for allotment by the fifth respondent was in regard to the hospital plot in Sector 23A and the letter given on 18.7.2005 could not be considered as an application for allotment of plot at Sector 51. It was submitted that HUDA ought to have allotted the plot at Sector 23A to fifth respondent and plot at Sector 51 to the appellant as per their respective applications. It was contended that by allotting the plot at Sector 51 to fifth respondent even though its application was for allotment of plot at Sector 23A, HUDA committed an irregularity, thereby denying the appellant to its legitimate claim for allotment of a plot. It is further contended that when the application in the prescribed form by fifth respondent was for allotment of plot at Sector 23A, there was no justification for allotting the plot at Sector 51 to fifth respondent. It was 5 submitted that the appellant fulfilled the eligibility/preference criteria specified in the advertisement for allotment of the plot. 8. Learned counsel for the State and HUDA submitted that a fresh advertisement was issued in the newspapers on 7.7.2005 extending the date for making applications till 20.7.2005 and the application dated 18.7.2005 given by fifth respondent sought allotment of the plot in Sector 51 and therefore the fifth respondent was an applicant for the plot at Sector 51 also. The fifth respondent submitted that it had applied for the alternative plot, that is plot at Sector 51 in pursuance to the re-advertisement on 7.7.2005 and therefore the allotment was legal. 9. Even though the application of fifth respondent for the plot at Sector 51 was not in the prescribed form, the allotment was made as long back as on 27.9.2005 and the fifth respondent has constructed and running the hospital even from 2007. The appellant filed the writ petition only on 2.4.2007, nearly one and a half years after the allotment. In the circumstances, the High Court was justified in not interfering with the allotment that was 6 made to the fifth respondent. We find no reason to interfere with the decision of the High Court. 10. At this stage the learned counsel for the appellant submitted that though there were several applications, ultimately, all other applications were withdrawn, and there were only two applications for the two plots, that is, appellant for hospital plot at Sector 51 and fifth respondent for hospital plot at Sector 23A. Learned counsel for the appellant submitted that the plot at Sector 51 having been allotted to the fifth respondent, HUDA ought to have at least allotted the plot at Sector 23A to appellant. The appellant submitted that it was ready and willing to accept the plot at Sector 23A on `as is where is basis', irrespective of the site condition. It is also submitted that the alternative prayer for allotment of the plot at Sector 23A made in the writ petition, was not considered by the High Court. 11. Having regard to the fact that the appellant had made a valid application for allotment and it was improperly rejected on account of HUDA allotting the plot applied for by the appellant to the fifth respondent (even though its application was for a different plot), HUDA may consider 7 the request of the appellant for allotment of the hospital plot at Sector 23A on such terms as it deems fit, as per its rules and regulations in accordance with law. 12. With the said observations, this appeal is disposed of. .........................................J. (R V Raveendran) New Delhi; ............................................J. January 19, 2011.
