"Bhaiyamiyan @ Jardar Khan & Anr vs State Of Madhya Pradesh on 3 May, 2011","802","BHAIYAMIYAN @ JARDAR KHAN & ANR. .. APPELLANT(S) vs. STATE OF MADHYA PRADESH .. RESPONDENT(S) O R D E R This appeal arises out of the following facts: At about 10.00 a.m. on the 30th August 1984 the prosecutrix (PW.1) had gone to relieve herself and as she was returning home, she was waylaid by the appellants who carried her to a nearby field and thereafter raped her and while leaving threatened her with dire consequences if she revealed what had happened to anyone. She however returned home and told her parents about the rape. Accompanied by her parents she then went to the police outpost at Pathriya to lodge a report but no police official was found present therein. A report was then lodged the next day at about 12.15 p.m. by PW.1 at Sironj Police Station about 22 k.m. away from the place of incident though the police station of village Kasbatal was Unarasital only 7 k.m. away.. The prosecutrix was accordingly sent for her medical examination to the hospital at Vasoda. Information was also sent to police Station Unarasital along with the -2- medical examination report Ex.P.A. and the subsequent investigation was conducted by the police of police station Unarasital who seized the petticoat of the prosecutrix and sent it for examination. On the completion of the investigation the accused were charged under Sec.376 (2)(g) of the IPC for having committed gang rape on PW.1. The Trial Court, vide its judgment dated the 6th January, 1992 observed that in the light of the fact that the FIR had been lodged after a delay of about 60 hours and that the statement of the prosecutrix was full of contradictions and as the statements of her father and mother (PW2 and PW.3) were based on the information given by her to them, no reliance could be placed on their evidence as well. The Court also found that in the light of the fact that the prosecutrix had declined to be medically examined at Sironj, where the First Information Report had been lodged, and had insisted that she be examined at Vasoda which was 55 k.ms. away, cast a doubt on the prosecution story. The court further observed that as per the medical evidence no injury had been found on her person though she had been raped by two persons and as such there was no evidence to suggest that rape had been committed. On a cumulative assessment of the prosecution evidence the Trial Court acquitted the accused. An appeal was thereafter filed by the State before the High Court. The High Court has given a finding that -3- the decision of the Trial Court was perverse and called for interference. The High Court has relied on the evidence of PW.1 and her parents as also on some part of the evidence of Dr. Mamta Sthapak-PW.7 who had medically examined the prosecutrix after about 24 hours. The High Court has accordingly allowed the appeal and sentenced the accused to 10 years R.I. with a fine of Rs.25,000/- under Section 376(2)(g) of the IPC, and in default of payment of fine, RI for two years. The matter is before us in the above background. At the very outset we must remark that the High Court's interference in an appeal against acquittal is somewhat circumscribed and if the view taken by the Trial Court was possible on the evidence, the High Court should stay its hands and not interfere in the matter in the belief that if it had been in Trial Court, it might have taken a different view. In other words, if two views are possible and the Trial Court has taken one, the High Court should not interfere in the judgment of the Trial Court. We have examined the evidence in the light of the above principle. We first see that the First Information Report had been lodged after about 60 hours of the incident. The prosecution case is that PW.1 accompanied by her parents had gone to police post Patharia attached to Police Station Unarasital immediately after the incident -4- but had found no police official present therein and had then gone to police station Sironj and lodged a report at 12 noon the next day. We find that the explanation for this delay is somewhat difficult to believe. A police post may have a few police officials posted in it, but police station Unarasital was a full fledged police station which would invariably be manned. Moreover, even if no one was found in the police post on the first day, at that particular point of time the effort of the prosecutrix ought to have been to lodge a report later at Police Station Unarasital, but she chose to go to police Station Sironj and recorded her statement and the investigation was thereafter referred to police station Unarasital. We are also indeed surprised that the High Court has made light of the fact that the prosecutrix had declined to undergo her medical examination at Sironj and had insisted for her medical examination at Vasoda, 55 k.m. away. The prosecution has not been able to furnish any explanation as to why the prosecutrix had insisted on being examined at Vasoda. We have also examined the medical report. Dr. Mamta Sthapak-PW.7 found no injury on her genetalia and deposed that there was no evidence to show that she had been raped as the tear in her hymen was an old one. The prosecutrix also stated that at the time of her medical examination at Vasoda her vagina had been stitched. The doctor found no stitch on her person. -5- We are therefore of the opinion that on a cumulative assessment of the evidence, as given above, the finding of the Trial Court could have been given under the circumstances and the High Court's interference was, therefore, not called for. The appeal is accordingly allowed, the conviction of the appellants is set aside and they are acquitted. The appellants are on bail; their bail bonds shall stand discharged. .................J.

Lodha Bench: Surinder Singh Nijjar , R.M. Lodha REPORTABLE IN THE SUPREME COURT OF INDIA CIVIL APPELLATE JURISDICTION CIVIL APPEAL NO. 1714 OF 2005 Hafeeza Bibi & Ors. .... Appellants Versus Shaikh Farid (Dead) by LRs. & Ors. ....Respondents JUDGMENT R.M. Lodha, J. This appeal, by special leave, arises from the judgment of the High Court of Andhra Pradesh dated September 13, 2004 whereby the Single Judge of that Court set aside the judgment and decree dated April 27, 1988 passed by the Principal, Subordinate Judge, Vishakhapatnam and remitted the matter back to the trial 1 court for the purpose of passing a preliminary decree after determining the shares to which each party would be entitled. 2. Shaik Dawood had three sons; Shaik Farid, Mehboob Subhani and Mohammed Yakub. He also had five daughters; Sappoora Bibi, Khairunnisa Begum, Noorajahan Begum, Rabia Bibi and Alima Bibi. All the five daughters were married. His wife predeceased him. Shaik Dawood retired as Reserve Head Constable. He was also a Unani Medical Practitioner. 3. Shaik Farid, Sappoora Bibi, Khairunnisa Begum, Noorajahan Begum and Mohd. Iqbal (son of Alima Bibi) - hereinafter referred to as `plaintiffs' - filed a suit for partition against Mehboob Subhani, Mohammed Yakub and Rabia Bibi (hereinafter referred to as `defendant 1', `defendant 2' and `defendant 3' respectively). The son and daughters of Syed Ali, who was brother of Shaik Dawood, were impleaded as other defendants (hereinafter referred to as `defendants 4 to 7'). 4. The parties are governed by Sunni Law. The plaintiffs averred in the plaint that Shaik Dawood died intestate on December 19, 1968 and the plaintiffs and defendants 1 to 3 became entitled to `A' schedule properties and half share in `B' schedule properties. The 2 plaintiffs stated that the defendants 4 to 7 are entitled to other half share in `B' schedule properties. 5. Mohammed Yakub -- defendant 2 -- contested the suit for partition. He set up the defence that Shaik Dawood executed hiba (gift deed) on February 5, 1968 and gifted his properties to him. Shaik Dawood put him in possession of the hiba properties on that day itself. The hiba became complete and the plaintiffs were fully aware of that fact. The defendant 2 in his written statement also referred to a previous suit for partition filed by some of the parties which was dismissed in default. 6. Some of the original parties have died during the pendency of the suit. Their legal representatives have been brought on record. 7. The trial court framed four issues. The issue relevant for the purpose of the present appeal is issue no.2 which is to the effect whether hiba dated February 5, 1968 is true, valid and binding on the plaintiffs. The trial court, after recording the evidence and on hearing the parties, answered issue no. 2 in the affirmative and, held that plaintiffs were not entitled to the shares claimed in the plaint. 3 Consequently, vide judgment and decree dated April 27, 1988, the trial court dismissed the plaintiffs' suit. 8. The plaintiffs challenged the judgment and decree of the trial court before the High Court. Inter alia, one of the arguments raised before the High Court on behalf of the appellants was that the gift dated February 5, 1968 being in writing was compulsorily required to be registered and stamped and in absence thereof, the gift deed could not be accepted or relied upon for any purpose and such unregistered gift deed would not confer any title upon the defendant 2. The High Court was persuaded by the argument and held that the unregistered gift deed would not pass any title to the defendant 2 as pleaded by him. The High Court, as indicated above, allowed the appeal; set aside the judgment and decree of the trial court and sent the matter back to that court for the purposes of passing a preliminary decree. 9. The present appellants are legal heirs of the deceased defendant 2. 10. As to whether or not the High Court is right in its view that the unregistered gift deed dated February 5, 1968 is not a valid gift 4 and conveyed no title to the defendant 2 is the question for determination in this appeal. 11. There is divergence of opinion amongst High Courts on the question presented before us. 12. The Privy Council in the case of Mohammad Abdul Ghani (since deceased) & Anr.v. Fakhr Jahan Begam & Ors.1 referred to `Mohammadan Law'; by Syed Ameer Ali and approved the statement made therein that three conditions are necessary for a valid gift by a Muslim: (a) manifestation of the wish to give on the part of the donor; (b) the acceptance of the donee, either impliedly or expressly; (c) the taking of possession of the subject-matter of the gift by the donee, either actually or constructively. 13. In Mahboob Sahab v. Syed Ismail and others2, this Court referred to the Principles of Mahomedan Law by Mulla, 19th Edition and in paragraph 5 (pp. 696-697) noticed the legal position, in relation to a gift by Muslim incorporated therein, thus : ""5. Under Section 147 of the Principles of Mahomedan Law by Mulla, 19th Edn., edited by Chief Justice M. Hidayatullah, envisages that writing is not essential to the validity of a gift either of moveable or of immovable property. Section 148 requires that it is essential to the validity of a gift that the donor should divest himself 1 1922 (49) IA 195 2 (1995) 3 SCC 693 5 completely of all ownership and dominion over the subject of the gift. Under Section 149, three essentials to the validity of the gift should be, (i) a declaration of gift by the donor, (ii) acceptance of the gift, express or implied, by or on behalf of the donee, and (iii) delivery of possession of the subject of the gift by the donor to the donee as mentioned in Section 150. If these conditions are complied with, the gift is complete. Section 150 specifically mentions that for a valid gift there should be delivery of possession of the subject of the gift and taking of possession of the gift by the donee, actually or constructively. Then only the gift is complete. Section 152 envisages that where the donor is in possession, a gift of immovable property of which the donor is in actual possession is not complete unless the donor physically departs from the premises with all his goods and chattels, and the donee formally enters into possession. It would, thus, be clear that though gift by a Mohammedan is not required to be in writing and consequently need not be registered under the Registration Act ; for a gift to be complete, there should be a declaration of the gift by the donor; acceptance of the gift, expressed or implied, by or on behalf of the donee, and delivery of possession of the property, the subject-matter of the gift by the donor to the donee. The donee should take delivery of the possession of that property either actually or constructively. On proof of these essential conditions, the gift becomes complete and valid. In case of immovable property in the possession of the donor, he should completely divest himself physically of the subject of the gift......."" 14. Section 123 of the Transfer of Property Act, 1882 (for short, ` T.P. Act ') lays down the manner in which gift of immoveable property may be effected. It reads thus : ""S.123. Transfer how effected. -- For the purpose of making a gift of immoveable property, the transfer must be effected by a registered instrument signed by or on behalf of the donor, and attested by at least two witnesses. 6 For the purpose of making a gift of moveable property, the transfer may be effected either by a registered instrument signed as aforesaid or by delivery. Such delivery may be made in the same way as goods sold may be delivered."" 15. However, an exception is carved out in Section 129 of the T.P. Act with regard to the gifts by a Mohammadan. It reads as follows: "" S.129 . Saving of donations mortis causa and Muhammadan Law. -- Nothing in this Chapter relates to gifts of moveable property made in contemplation of death, or shall be deemed to affect any rule of Muhammadan law."" 16. At this stage, we may also refer to Section 17 of the Registration Act, 1908 which makes registration of certain documents compulsory. Section 17 of the Registration Act, to the extent it is necessary, reads as follows : "" S.17 . Documents of which registration is compulsory. --(1) The following documents shall be registered, if the property to which they relate is situate in a district in which, and if they have been executed on or after the date on which, Act No. XVI of 1864, or the Indian Registration Act, 1866 , or the Indian Registration Act, 1871 , or the Indian Registration Act, 1877 , or this Act came or comes into force, namely:-- (a) instruments of gift of immovable property; (b) . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . ; (c) . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . ; 7 (d) . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .. . ; (e) . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . ."" 17. Section 49 of the Registration Act deals with the effect of non-registration of documents required to be registered. It reads thus: "" S.49 . Effect of non- registration of documents required to be registered.- No document required by section 17 or by any provision of the Transfer of Property Act, 1882 (4 of 1882), to be registered shall-- (a) affect any immovable property comprised therein or (b) confer any power to adopt, or (c) be received as evidence of any transaction affecting such property or conferring such power, unless it has been registered: Provided that an unregistered document affecting immovable property and required by this Act or the Transfer of Property Act, 1882 (4 of 1882 ), to be registered may be received as evidence of a contract in a suit for specific performance under Chapter II of the Specific Relief Act, 1877 (3 of 1877 ), or as evidence of any collateral transaction not required to be effected by registered instrument."" 18. Section 17(1)(a) of the Registration Act leaves no manner of doubt that an instrument of gift of immoveable property requires registration irrespective of the value of the property. The question is about its applicability to a written gift executed by a Mohammadan in 8 the light of Section 129 of the T.P. Act and the rule of Mohammadan Law relating to gifts. 19. In the case of Nasib Ali v. Wajed Ali3 , the contention was raised before the Division Bench of the Calcutta High Court that the deed of gift, not being registered under the Registration Act , is not admissible in evidence. The Calcutta High Court held that a deed of gift by a Mohammadan is not an instrument effecting, creating or making the gift but a mere piece of evidence. This is what the High Court said : "".........The position under the Mahomedan Law is this : that a gift in order to be valid must be made in accordance with the forms stated above; and even if it is evidenced by writing, unless all the essential forms are observed, it is not valid according to law. That being so, a deed of gift executed by a Mahomedan is not the instrument effecting, creating or making the gift but a mere piece of evidence. It may so happen after a lapse of time that the evidence of the observance of the above forms might not be forthcoming, so it is sometimes thought prudent; to reduce the fact that a gift has been made into writing. Such writing is not a document of title but is a piece of evidence. 3. The law with regard to the gift being complete by declaration and delivery of possession is so clear that in a case before their Lordships of the Judicial Committee Kamarunnissa Bibi v. Hussaini Bibi [1880] 3 All. 266, where a gift was said to have been made in lieu of dower, their Lordships held that the requisite forms having been observed it was not necessary to enquire whether there was any consideration for the gift or whether there was any dower due. The case of Karam Ilahi v. Sharfuddin [1916] 3 AIR 1927 Cal 197 9 38 All. 212 is similar in principle to the present case. There also a deed relating to the gift was executed. The learned Judge held that if the gift was valid under the Mahomedan Law it was none the less valid because there was a deed of gift which, owing to some defect, was invalid under Section 123 , Transfer of Property Act, and could not be used in evidence. 4. The next, question that calls for consideration is whether a document like the present one executed by a Mahomedan donor after he made a gift to show that he had made it in favour of the donee is compulsorily registrable under the Registration Act . Under Section 17 of the Registration Act an instrument of gift must be registered. By the expression 'instrument of gift of immovable property' I understand an instrument or deed which creates, makes or completes the gift, thereby transferring the ownership of the property from the executant to the person in whose favour it is executed. In order to affect the immovable property, the document must be a document of transfer; and if it is a document of transfer it must be registered under the provisions of the Registration Act . 5. The present document does not affect immovable property. It does not transfer the immovable property from the donor to the donee. It only affords evidence of the fact that the donor has observed the formalities under the Mahomedan Law in making the gift to the donee. I am prepared to go so far as to hold that a document like the present one is not compulsorily registrable under the Registration Act , or the Registration Act does not apply to a so-called deed of gift executed by a Mahomedan. But for purposes of the present case it is not necessary to go so far because I hold that this document is only a piece of evidence, and conceding that it should, have been registered, the effect of its non-registration is to make it inadmissible in evidence under Section 49 of the Registration Act........."" 10 20. In Sankesula Chinna Budde Saheb v. Raja Subbamma4, the Andhra Pradesh High Court, after noticing the three essentials of a gift under the Mohammadan Law, held that if a gift was reduced to writing, it required registration under Section 17(1)(a) of the Registration Act. It went on to hold that even if by virtue of Section 129 of the T.P. Act, a deed of gift executed by Mohammadan was not required to comply with the provisions of Section 123 of the T.P. Act, still it had to be registered under Section 17(1)(a) of the Registration Act when the gift related to immoveable property. 21. A Full Bench of the Andhra Pradesh High Court in the case of Inspector General of Registration and Stamps, Govt. of Hyderabad v. Smt. Tayyaba Begum5, was called upon to decide on a reference made by the Board of Revenue under Section 55 of the Hyderabad Stamp Act whether the document under consideration therein was a gift deed or it merely evidenced a past transaction. The High Court applied the test - whether the parties regarded the instrument to be a receptacle and appropriate evidence of the transaction; was it intended to constitute the gift or was it to serve as a record of a past event - and held as under : 4 1954 2 MLJ 113 5 AIR 1962 Andhra Pradesh 199 11 ""12. We have to examine the document in question in the light of these rules. No doubt, there was recitals therein which relate to past transaction. But that is not decisive of the matter. What is the purpose which it was designed to serve? That the executant did not treat it as a memorandum of a completed hiba is evident from some of the sentences. In the deed, such as ""I deemed it necessary to execute a deed also making a declaration in favour of my son...in accordance with the Muslim law"", and the last portion of the document. The anxiety of the donor to free the title of the donee to the property from all doubts and to save him from future litigation is clearly exhibited in the last sentence. ""I pray that no one may have any kind of doubt regarding the ownership of Syed Ehasan Hussain and that if per chance any doubt at all should arise, this deed of Ekrarnama may prove sufficient."" This sentence is expressive of her intention to silence all doubts regarding the ownership of the property with the aid of this document. She did not want anyone to challenge the title of the donee to the house in question. This object could be attained only if it is regarded as a conveyance, a document which effected the transfer by its own force. If, on the other hand, if it is a mere record of a past transaction, that would not have the desired effect. There is one circumstance which gives some indication as to the intention of the executant of the document. The document is attested by two witnesses as required by Section 123 of the Transfer of Property Act. No doubt, this is not conclusive of the matter. But it is indicative of the desire of the executant that it should serve as evidence of the gift and not as a memorandum of a past transaction."" 22. In Makku Rawther's Children: Assan Ravther and others v. Manahapara Charayil6, V.R. Krishna Iyer, J. (as His Lordship then 6 AIR 1972 Kerala 27 12 was) did not agree with the test applied by the Full Bench of Andhra Pradesh High Court and the reasoning given in Tayyaba Begum5 . He held in paragraphs 8 and 9 of the report thus : ""8. I regret my inability to agree with the reasoning in these decisions. In the context of Section 17 , a document is the same as an instrument and to draw nice distinctions between the two only serves to baffle, not to ill mine. Mulla says: ""The words `document' and `instrument' are used interchangeable in the Act"". An instrument of gift is one whereby a gift is made. Where in law a gift cannot be effected by a registered deed as such, it cannot be an instrument of gift. The legal position is well-settled. A Muslim gift may be valid even without a registered deed and may be invalid even with a registered deed. Registration being irrelevant to its legal force, a deed setting out Muslim gift cannot be regarded as constitutive of the gift and is not compulsorily registerable."" 9. Against this argument counsel invoked the authority of the Andhra Pradesh Full Bench. One may respect the ruling but still reiect the reasoning. The Calcutta Bench in AIR 1927 Cal 197 has discussed the issue from the angle I have presented. The logic of the law matters more than the judicial numbers behind a view. The Calcutta Bench argued: ""The essentials of a gift under the Mahomedan law are ..... A simple gift can only be made by going through the above formalities and no written instrument is required. In fact no writing is necessary to validate a gift; and if a gift is made by a written instrument without delivery of possession, it is invalid in law ..... That being so, a deed of gift executed by a Mahomedan is not the instrument effecting, creating or making the gift but a mere piece of evidence ..... Under Section 17 of the Registration Act an instrument of gift must be 13 registered. By the expression 'instrument of gift of immovable property' I understand an instrument or deed which creates, makes or completes the gift thereby transferring the ownership of the property ..... The present document does not affect immovable property. It does not transfer an immovable property from the donor to the donee which only affords evidence of the fact that the donor has observed the formalities under the Mahomedan law in making the gift ..... I am prepared to go so far as to hold that a document like the present one is not compulsorily registrable under the Registration Act , or the Registration Act does not apply to a so-called deed of gift executed by a Mahomedan."" These observations of Suhrawardy, J. have my respectful concurrence. So confining myself to this contention for the nonce, I am inclined to hold that Ext. B1 is admissible notwithstanding Ss. 17 and 49 of the Indian Registration Act . This conclusion, however, is little premature if I may anticipate my opinion on the operation of Section 129 of the Transfer of Property Act expressed later in this judgment. Indeed, in the light of my interpretation of Section 129, Ext. B1 needs to be registered. For the present I indicate my conclusion, if the law of gifts for Muslims were not to be governed by Section 129."" 23. The Full Bench of Jammu and Kashmir High Court in Ghulam Ahmad Sofi v. Mohd. Sidiq Dareel and others7 had an occasion to consider the question whether in view of the provisions of Sections 123 and 129 of the T.P. Act, the rule of gifts in Mohammadan Law stands superseded; and whether it is necessary that there should be a registered instrument as required by Sections 7 AIR 1974 Jammu & Kashmir 59 14 123 and 138 of the T.P. Act in the case of gifts made under that Law. The Full Bench noticed the statutory provisions and also decisions of different High Courts including the decision of Calcutta High Court in the case of Nasib Ali3. The Full Bench held as follows : ""14. The ratio of the above cited authorities is therefore in favour of the proposition that an oral gift made under the Muslim law would not be affected by Section 123 of the Transfer of Property Act and the gift if it has otherwise all the attributes of a valid gift under the Muslim Law would not become invalid because there is no instrument in writing and registered. Therefore the answer to the question formulated would be in the negative i.e. that Sections 123 and 129 of the Transfer of Property Act do not supersede the Muslim law on matters relating to making of oral gifts, that it is not essential that there should be a registered instrument as required by Sections 123 and 138 of the Transfer of Property Act in such cases. But if there is executed an instrument and its execution is contemporaneous with the making of the gift then in that case the instrument must be registered as provided under Section 17 of the Registration Act. If, however, the making of the gift is an antecedent act and a deed is executed afterwards as evidencing the said transaction that does not require registration as it is an instrument made after the gift is made and does not therefore create, make or complete the gift thereby transferring the ownership of the property from the executant to the person in whose favour it is executed."" 24. The Single Judge of the Andhra Pradesh High Court in the case of Chota Uddandu Sahib v. Masthan Bi (died) and others8, was concerned with the question about the gift by Mohammadan. The 8 AIR 1975 Andhra Pradesh 271 15 Single Judge referred to some of the decisions noticed above and few other decisions and held in paragraph 10 of the report thus : ""10. Under Section 129 of the Transfer of Property Act, nothing in Chapter VII relates to gifts of movable property made in contemplation of death or shall be deemed to affect any rule of Mohammadan Law. According to the Mohammedan Law, there can be a valid gift, if three essentials of the gift are satisfied. (1) a declaration of the gift by the donor, (2) the acceptance of the gift express or implied by or on behalf of the donee and (3) delivery of possession of the subject of gift by the donor to the donee. If these conditions are complied with the gift is complete. According to Muslim law it is not necessary that there should be a deed of gift in order to make it a valid gift, but of course, if there is a deed it should be registered. But if the deed is merely a memoranda of an already effected gift, then it stands on a separate footing. In view of this specific provision of Muslim Law, which is saved by Section 129 , it cannot be held that the gifts amongst muslims also should satisfy the provisions of Chapter VII. . . . . . . . . . . . Hence if all the formalities, as prescribed by Muslim Law, regarding the making of gifts are satisfied, the gift is valid notwithstanding the fact that it is oral and without any instrument. If there is a contemporaneous document it should be registered. But if the gift is antecedent and the deed is subsequent merely evidencing the past transaction, it does not require registration, because it does not by itself make or complete the gift. . . . . . . . . ."" 25. In the case of Amirkhan v. Ghouse Khan9 , one of the questions that arose for consideration before the Madras High Court was : whether the gift of the immoveable property by Mohammadan, if reduced to writing, required registration. The Single Judge of the 9 (1985) 2 MLJ 136 16 Madras High Court concluded that though a Mohammadan could create a valid gift orally, if he should reduce the same in writing, the gift will not be valid unless it is duly registered. 26. In the case of Md. Hesabuddin and others v. Md. Hesaruddin and others10, the question with regard to gift of immoveable property written on ordinary unstamped paper arose before the Gauhati High Court. That was a case where a Mohammadan mother made a gift of land in favour of her son by a gift deed written on ordinary unstamped paper. The Single Judge of the High Court relying upon an earlier decision of that Court in Jubeda Khatoon v. Moksed Ali11 held as under: ""..... But it cannot be taken as sine qua non in all cases that wherever there is a writing about a Mahomedan gift of immovable property, there must be registration thereof. The facts and circumstances of each case have to be taken into consideration before finding whether the writing requires registration or not. The essential requirements, as said before, to make a Mahomedan gift valid are declaration by the donor, acceptance by the donee and delivery of possession to the donee. It was held in Jubeda Khatoon v. Moksed Ali, AIR 1973 Gau 105 (at p. 106)- ""Under the Mahomedan Law three things are necessary for creation of a gift. They are (i) declaration of gift by the donor, (ii) acceptance of the gift express or implied by or on behalf of the donee and (iii) delivery of possession of the subject of the gift by the donor to the donee. The deed of 10 AIR 1984 Gauhati 41 11 AIR 1973 Gauhati 105 17 gift is immaterial for creation of gift under the Mahomedan Law. A gift under the Mahomedan Law is not valid if the above mentioned essentials are not fulfilled, even if there be a deed of gift or even a registered deed of gift. In other words even if there be a declaration of acceptance of the gift, there will be no valid gift under the Mahomedan Law if there be no delivery of possession, even though there may be registered deed of gift."" In that case there was a deed of gift which was not produced during trial. Still it was found in that case that had the defendants produced the deed of gift, at best it would have proved a declaration of the gift by the donor and acceptance thereof by the donee. It was further held that despite this the defendants would have to lead independent oral evidence to prove delivery of possession in order to prove a valid gift. Therefore it was found in that case that deed of gift under the Mahomedan Law does not create a disposition of property. Relying on this it cannot be said that whenever there is a writing with regard to a gift executed by the donor, it must be proved as a basic instrument of gift before deciding the gift to be valid. In the instant case a mere writing in the plain paper as aforesaid containing the declaration of gift cannot tantamount to a formal instrument of gift. Ext. A (2) has in the circumstances of the present case to be taken as a form of declaration of the donor. In every case the intention of the donor, the background of the alleged gift and the relation of the donor and the donee as well as the purpose or motive of the gift all have to be taken into consideration. In the present case, it is recited in the said writings that the 3rd defendant has been maintaining and looking after the donor and that the other children of the donor were neglecting her. The gift was from a mother to a son and it was based on love and affection for the son in whose favour the gift was made. Therefore, it cannot be held that because a declaration is contained in the paper Ext. A (2) the latter must have been registered in order to render the gift valid. Admittedly, the 3rd defendant has been possessing the land and got his name mutated in the revenue records with respect to the land. It is therefore implied that there was acceptance on behalf of the donee and also that the possession of the property was delivered to the donee by the donor. It should be remembered that unless there was possession on behalf of the 3rd 18 defendant, no mutation would have taken place with regard to the property. It may be repeated that Ext. A (2) has to be taken in the present case as a mere declaration of the donor in presence of the witnesses who are said to have attested the writing."" 27. The position is well settled, which has been stated and restated time and again, that the three essentials of a gift under Mohammadan Law are; (i) declaration of the gift by the donor; (2) acceptance of the gift by the donee and (3) delivery of possession. Though, the rules of Mohammadan Law do not make writing essential to the validity of a gift; an oral gift fulfilling all the three essentials make the gift complete and irrevocable. However, the donor may record the transaction of gift in writing. Asaf A. A. Fyzee in Outlines of Muhammadan Law, Fifth Edition (edited and revised by Tahir Mahmood) at page 182 states in this regard that writing may be of two kinds : (i) it may merely recite the fact of a prior gift; such a writing need not be registered. On the other hand, (ii) it may itself be the instrument of gift; such a writing in certain circumstances requires registration. He further says that if there is a declaration, acceptance and delivery of possession coupled with the formal instrument of a gift, it must be registered. Conversely, the author says that registration, 19 however, by itself without the other necessary conditions, is not sufficient. 28. Mulla, Principles of Mahomedan Law (19th Edition), Page 120, states the legal position in the following words : ""Under the Mahomedan law the three essential requisites to make a gift valid : (1) declaration of the gift by the donor: (2) acceptance of the gift by the donee expressly or impliedly and (3) delivery of possession to and taking possession thereof by the donee actually or constructively. No written document is required in such a case. Section 129 Transfer of Property Act, excludes the rule of Mahomedan law from the purview of Section 123 which mandates that the gift of immovable property must be effected by a registered instrument as stated therein. But it cannot be taken as a sine qua non in all cases that whenever there is a writing about a Mahomedan gift of immovable property there must be registration thereof. Whether the writing requires registration or not depends on the facts and circumstances of each case."" 29. In our opinion, merely because the gift is reduced to writing by a Mohammadan instead of it having been made orally, such writing does not become a formal document or instrument of gift. When a gift could be made by Mohammadan orally, its nature and character is not changed because of it having been made by a written document. What is important for a valid gift under Mohammadan Law is that three essential requisites must be fulfilled. The form is immaterial. If all the three essential requisites are satisfied constituting 20 valid gift, the transaction of gift would not be rendered invalid because it has been written on a plain piece of paper. The distinction that if a written deed of gift recites the factum of prior gift then such deed is not required to be registered but when the writing is contemporaneous with the making of the gift, it must be registered, is inappropriate and does not seem to us to be in conformity with the rule of gifts in Mohammadan Law. 30. In considering what is the Mohammadan Law on the subject of gifts inter vivos, the Privy Council in Mohammad Abdul Ghani1 stated that when the old and authoritative texts of Mohammadan Law were promulgated there were not in contemplation of any one any Transfer of Property Acts, any Registration Acts, any Revenue Courts to record transfers of possession of land, and that could not have been intended to lay down for all time what should alone be the evidence that titles to lands had passed. 31. Section 129 of T.P. Act preserves the rule of Mohammadan Law and excludes the applicability of Section 123 of T.P. Act to a gift of an immovable property by a Mohammadan. We find ourselves in express agreement with the statement of law reproduced above from Mulla, Principles of Mahomedan Law (19th 21 Edition), page 120. In other words, it is not the requirement that in all cases where the gift deed is contemporaneous to the making of the gift then such deed must be registered under Section 17 of the Registration Act. Each case would depend on its own facts. 32. We are unable to concur with the view of the Full Bench of Andhra Pradesh High Court in the case of Tayyaba Begum5. We approve the view of the Calcutta High Court in Nasib Ali3 that a deed of gift executed by a Mohammadan is not the instrument effecting, creating or making the gift but a mere piece of evidence, such writing is not a document of title but is a piece of evidence. 33. We also approve the view of the Gauhati High Court in the case of Md. Hesabuddin10 . The judgments to the contrary by Andhra Pradesh High Court, Jammu and Kashmir High Court and Madras High Court do not lay down the correct law. 34. Now, as regards the facts of the present case, the gift was made by Shaik Dawood by a written deed dated February 5, 1968 in favour of his son Mohammed Yakub in respect of the properties `A' schedule and `B' schedule appended thereto. The gift - as is recited in the deed - was based on love and affection for Mohammed Yakub 22 as after the death of donor's wife, he has been looking after and helping him. Can it be said that because a declaration is reduced to writing, it must have been registered? We think not. The acceptance of the gift by Mohammed Yakub is also evidenced as he signed the deed. Mohammed Yakub was residing in the `B' schedule property consisting of a house and a kitchen room appurtenant thereto and, thus, was in physical possession of residential house with the donor. The trial court on consideration of the entire evidence on record has recorded a categorical finding that Shaik Dawood (donor), executed the gift deed dated February 5, 1968 in favour of donee (Mohammed Yakub), the donee accepted the gift and the donor handed over the properties covered by the gift deed to the donee. The trial court further held that all the three essentials of a valid gift under the Mohammadan Law were satisfied. The view of the trial court is in accord with the legal position stated by us above. The gift deed dated February 5, 1968 is a form of declaration by the donor and not an instrument of gift as contemplated under Section 17 of the Registration Act. As all the three essential requisites are satisfied by the gift deed dated February 5, 1968, the gift in favour of defendant 2 became complete and irrevocable. 23 35. The High Court in the impugned judgment relied upon the Full Bench decision in the case of Tayyaba Begum5 but we have already held that the view of the Full Bench in Tayyaba Begum5 is not a correct view and does not lay down the correct law. 36. Consequently, the appeal is allowed and the judgment and order dated September 13, 2004 passed by the High Court of Andhra Pradesh is set aside. The judgment and decree dated April 27, 1988 passed by the Principal, Subordinate Judge, Vishakhapatnam is restored. The parties shall bear their own costs. ........................ J. (R.M.

Krishna Devi and Others ....Appellants Versus State of Uttaranchal & Anr. ...Respondents JUDGMENT Swatanter Kumar, J. 1. By this common judgment, we propose to dispose of the afore-noticed six Civil Appeals as they arise from different judgments of the High Court of Uttaranchal but are result of a common Notification issued under Section 4(1) of the Land Acquisition Act, 1894 (in short the `Act') and thus are based upon similar facts and documentary and oral evidence. FACTS: C. A. Nos.7496-7497 of 2005 and 7498-7499 of 2005 On 30th January, 1992, the Government of Uttar 2. Pradesh (now the State of Uttaranchal) issued a Notification under Section 4(1) of the Act for acquiring 3 some land for a public purpose, namely the construction of Government Polytechnic Institute in the District of Dehradun. This Notification came to be published in the Official Gazette on 22nd February, 1992. On 18th April 1992, declaration under Section 6(1) of the Act was issued which was published in the Official Gazette on 12th May, 1992 identifying the land admeasuring 12.85 acres for acquisition for the said purpose in village Sewala Kalan, Pargana Kendriya Doon, District Dehradun, out of which lands admeasuring 4.58 acres and 3.031 acres belonged to the first and the second claimant respectively. In furtherance to this Notification, possession of the acquired land was taken on 7th July, 1992. The Special Land Acquisition Officer (in short the `SLAO') pronounced his award on 8th June, 1993. While determining compensation, the SLAO applied belting system to the acquired land and assessed the market value of the first belt admeasuring 0.56 acres at the rate of ` 9,78,223.40 per acre, second belt admeasuring 1.38 acres at the rate of ` 6,52,482.27 4 per acre and for the third belt admeasuring 10.91 acres at the rate of ` 4,39,362.70 per acre. However, the claimants, being dissatisfied with the award of the SLAO, filed applications under Section 18 of the Act which in turn came to be referred to the Court of competent jurisdiction (hereinafter referred to as the `Reference Court'). The Reference Court, in LA Case No. 386 of 1993, 3. considered the list of 140 sale instances attached with the award of the SLAO. It noticed that the SLAO had relied on sale instance at serial no. 43 related to land admeasuring 0.094 acre for a total consideration of ` 92,000 and assessed the market value of acquired land at the rate of ` 9,78,723 per acre before applying the belting system. This sale deed was executed on 10th June, 1991 and the land was from the revenue estate of the same village but at some distance from the acquired land. The Reference Court also noticed the evidence of DW 1, Ram Singh, who had stated that ITBP quarters are located to the north of the acquired 5 land; and to the east of ITBP Colony, is a 20 feet wide passage which ends on the acquired land. A high tension line of 1100 K.V. also runs near the acquired land. This witness admitted that the land in question was full of residential potentialities. Reliance was also placed upon the statements of PW7 and PW8 in regard to the urbanization of the surrounding areas and the potential of the land in question for building construction and residential purposes. Out of those 140 sale instances, sale instance at 4. serial Nos. 109 and 110 are stated to be the sale deeds executed on 26th November, 1991 and 27th November, 1991, which were heavily relied upon by the Reference Court. The Reference Court vide its judgment-cum- award dated 12th May, 1995 held application of belting system improper as entire land was acquired for one purpose, i.e. construction of Government Polytechnic Institute. It determined the market value of the land at the rate of ` 6,40,000 per bigha and after applying 20% deduction, enhanced compensation to flat rate of ` 5,12,000 per bigha along with other statutory benefits. 6 The State, aggrieved by the enhancement of 5. compensation awarded to the claimants by the Reference Court, preferred appeals being First Appeal Nos. 920-921 of 2001, before the concerned High Court. The High Court vide its judgment dated 20th July, 2005, primarily accepted the findings recorded by the Reference Court on merits and merely raised the deduction from 20% to 33.33% thus awarding the compensation at the rate of ` 4,26,667 per bigha. The High Court recorded a definite finding that the Reference Court was fully justified in setting aside the order of the SLAO applying belting system for determination of compensation in relation to the acquired land. It also did not consider it appropriate to rely upon the sale instances placed on record by the State and practically affirmed the findings of the Reference Court including finding based upon sale instances at serial Nos. 109 and 110 for determining the market value of the acquired land. The High Court modified the order of the Reference Court only by raising the deduction on account of development 7 charges and fixing of the final amount of compensation as afore-indicated. 6. Against the above judgment of the High Court, Civil Appeal Nos.7498-7499 of 2005 have been preferred by the State of Uttaranchal while Civil Appeal Nos. 7496- 7497 of 2005 have been preferred by the claimants. C.A. No. 1122 OF 2011 Civil Appeal No. 1122 of 2011 has been preferred by 7. the State of Uttaranchal against the judgment of the Uttaranchal High Court dated 9th March, 2006 passed in First Appeal Nos. 918 and 919 of 2001. Vide that order the Court had primarily relied upon another judgment of the Division Bench of that Court passed in First Appeal Nos. 920-921 of 2001 (in the case of State of U.P. through Collector, Dehradun v. Smt. Trishla Jain) and awarded compensation at the rate of ` 4,26,667 per bigha reducing the compensation of ` 5,12,000 per bigha as awarded by the Reference Court. The High Court in this case had echoed in entirety the reasoning and compensation awarded by 8 the other Bench in the case of Trishala Jain (supra). This judgment of the High Court, impugned in Civil Appeal No. 1122 of 2011, therefore has to be treated at parity for all intents and purposes with the impugned judgment in Civil Appeal Nos. 7496-7497 of 2005 and Civil Appeal Nos. 7498-7499 of 2005. C.A. No. 3613 of 2008 8. Civil Appeal No. 3613 of 2008 is directed against the judgment of the Uttaranchal High Court dated 11th May, 2006 passed in First Appeal Nos. 60-63 of 2001. It is necessary for us to notice the facts giving rise to this appeal separately because there are certain distinguishing features with regard to factual matrix as well as evidence of this case. The land in question in this case also forms part of the land admeasuring 12.85 acres sought to be acquired by the Notification dated 30th January, 1992 issued under Section 4(1) of the Act and is covered by the common award passed by the SLAO on 8th June, 1993 awarding the compensation at the same rate as in other cases. The claimants herein made a separate reference 9 under Section 18 of the Act and the Reference Court, in LA Case No. 121 of 1994, awarded compensation at the rate of ` 12,50,000 per acre (i.e. ` 2,38,095.24 per bigha approximately) in addition to granting other statutory benefits and interests. It needs to be noticed that the two sale instances at serial Nos. 109 and 110, which were the foundation of the judgment pronounced by the Reference Court in other cases, i.e. sale deeds dated 26th November, 1991, and 27th November,1991, had been rejected on the ground that they were not admissible in evidence as neither the vendor nor the vendee had been produced to prove the sale instances in Court. The Reference Court also noticed the contention raised on behalf of the State, i.e. these sale instances were collusive. It will be useful to refer to the relevant part of the judgment of the Reference Court which reads as under: ""The respondent No.2 have (sic) taken a special stand in his written statement that the sale deed executed by Sri Viresh Jain was forged and fictitious and collusive and no reliance can be placed on such a sale deed. He has further argued that the judgment passed in L.A. Case No. 386 of 1993 Smt. Trishla Jain vs. Collector and another in such 10 circumstances cannot be made the basis for awarding compensation in the present case. The rtno. 2 has filed voluminous documents in support of their case that the sale deed executed by Sri Viresh Jain were collusive and were made only to create evidence of hither compensation. He has further filed various documents, which supports the contention of the respondent no. 2 that Sri Dinesh Jain and Sri Viresh Jain themselves offered their 100 bigha of land in village phoolsani for the purpose of Government polytechnic. He has also filed documents and the copy of the Selection Committee in which Sri Manoj Kumar Jain, Upkhand Adhikari, U.S.E.B. was a member, Sri Manoj Kumar Jain was examined as a witness. He was admitted that he is the brother in law of Sri Dinesh Jain and Sri Viresh Jain. He has also admitted that he was member of the selection committee which was to select the land for Government polytechnic. Various other documents were also filed by the respondent no. 2 vide which the signatures of Jinendra Kumar Jain and Smt. Veena Kumar Jain were identified by Sri Dinesh Jain. His sole concentration was that the sale deed executed by Sri Viresh Jain was collusive and since Sri Manoj Kumar Jain was one of the member of the selection committee appointed for the acquisition of land for Government Polytechnic, the information was leaked to Sri Viresh Jain and, therefore, they manipulated these two sale deeds by transferring the land to their near relations say the sister and the son of his BUA without passing valid consideration. The learned counsel for 11 the respondent no. 2 has placed reliance on the law laid down by the Hon'ble Supreme Court in AIR 1951 page (sic) 16 Yashvant Deoro vs. Jai Chand Ram Chand. It is correct that the fraudulent motive or design is not capable of direct proof in most of the cases. Such intention could only be inferred. It is worthy to point out that the two sale deeds relied upon by the claimants executed by Sri Viresh Jain in favour of Sri Jinendra Kumar Jain and Smt. Veena Kumar Jain have not been proved in accordance with law as laid down by the Hon'ble Supreme Court in as much as vendee or vendor of these sale deeds or any attesting witnesses have not been produced in evidence. Therefore, they cannot be made the basis of awarding of compensation in the present case. The judgment in L.A. Case No. 386 of 1993 Smt. Trishala Jain v. Collector and another is under appeal and the entire matter with regard to the alleged collusive sale deed is yet to be thrashed out. Therefore, it is not fair and justified for this court to comment upon these sale deeds. For the purpose of decision of this case it is only sufficient, if these two sale deeds are discarded and if they are not considered and not made the basis for awarding compensation in these cases. Therefore, it is held that these two sale deeds cannot be made basis for awarding any compensation, in the present case and the argument of the claimants fails in this respect."" Having held thus, the Reference Court relied upon 12 the sale instance at serial No. 108, out of 140 sale instances, of the list produced and proved by the SLAO. As per the sale instance at serial No. 108, a land admeasuring 0.90 acre was sold at the rate of `12,55,550.50 per acre on 29th November, 1991. Examining this document with other evidence on record, particularly statement of DW2, the Reference Court finally awarded compensation at the rate of `12,50,000 per acre without applying any deduction. The claimants, aggrieved by the above judgment of the Reference Court dated 6th February, 2001, preferred an appeal before the Uttaranchal High Court. The High Court, vide its judgment dated 11th May, 2006, while referring to the different judgments of this Court as well as of different High Courts, opined that the Reference Court had fallen in error of law in not applying, to a certain extent, deduction from the market value determined by that court in accordance with law. The High Court did not interfere with the determination of the market value of the acquired land but applied a deduction of 33.33% on such value and finally awarded compensation to the claimants at the rate of 13 `8,33,334 per acre with other statutory benefits and interests thereupon. Dissatisfied with this judgment of the High Court reducing the compensation awarded by the Reference Court, the claimants-Krishna Devi and others have filed the present appeal before this Court. Questions of Fact and Law that fall for Determination: 9. On examination of the present appeals, the following common questions arise for consideration of this Court: I. Whether or not the belting system ought to have been applied for determination of fair market value of the acquired land? II. What should be the just and fair market value of the acquired land on the date of issuance of notification under Section 4 of the Act? III. Whether in the facts and circumstances of the present case there ought to be any deduction after determining the fair market value of the land? IV. What compensation and benefits are the claimants entitled to? 14 Question No. 1. 10. As already noticed, the SLAO, in all cases, while giving its award had applied the belting system and categorizing the land into three different categories had awarded the compensation accordingly. However, the Reference Court had held that the land as a whole was similarly placed and was surrounded by developed areas and it was to be used for one purpose, i.e. construction of Government Polytechnic Institute, thus there was no question of applying the belting system. Keeping in view the documentary and oral evidence on record, the Reference Court set aside the belting system and awarded uniform compensation to all the claimants. This finding of the Reference Court was upheld by the High Court in the impugned judgments. The correctness of this concurrent view has also not been questioned by any of the parties in the present appeals before us. Therefore, concurrent finding recorded by the Courts below which remained unchallenged before this Court need not be disturbed by this Court. 15 Question No. II 11. Now, we have to examine the most important question arising in the present appeal as to how this Court should determine the fair market value of the acquired land in the given facts and circumstances. First of all, we need to refer to the evidence that was produced by the parties in support of their respective claims. The principal evidence relied upon by the claimants in all these cases are the two sale instances shown at serial Nos. 109 and 110. These were executed by Shri Viresh Jain, in favour of Jitendra Kumar and Smt. Veena Kumari, on 26th November, 1991 and 27th November, 1991 respectively. These lands are situated in Khasra No. 39/2, a part of which was acquired under the same Notification. Under these sale deeds areas of 440.8 sq. yards and 283.3 sq. yards were sold at the rate of ` 32,72,603.49 and ` 34,87,648.30 per acre respectively. The claimants in different cases examined themselves to prove these sale instances as a whole, as they are the main witnesses and the sale instances were also executed between themselves. It needs to be noticed that one of the 16 purchasers and the seller are the claimants in the present appeals and the other purchaser is their close relative. According to the claimants, they were entitled to compensation on the basis of these two sale instances. The claimants have also brought on record documents, viz., Exh.11 and Exh.12, which are the agreements signed between Trishala Jain and one Vikram Singh Bangari, executed on 23rd April, 1991 for the purpose of leveling of the land in question. Shri Bangari was examined as PW 6 who submitted that he had completed the leveling work on or before 3rd February, 1992. Further, the testimony of PW7, according to the claimants, clearly shows that there was urbanization all over the periphery of municipal limits and building activities were increased even beyond the municipal limits. Claimants have also relied upon other evidence including the cross examination of DW 1, Ram Singh, who admitted that these sale deeds were unlikely to have been executed at higher rate for enhancing the rate of compensation of the acquired land. As we have already noticed, this witness also gave the statement that towards the North of the acquired land, there were several quarters 17 of ITBP and there was 20 feet wide passage which ended on the acquired land. He further stated that some shops are located in the South of the acquired land across the road and facilities of schools and post office are also available near the acquired land. On the backdrop of this entire evidence, the claimants contended that the deduction applied by the High Court is not justified and their claim for compensation in line with the two sale instances proved by them on record is to be upheld. According to them, the sale instances produced by the SLAO were far away from the acquired land and were not relevant or comparable instances. 12. On the other hand, the SLAO, in his award, had considered details of 140 sale instances executed over a period from the Revenue Estate of the same Village. Most of these sale instances were found to be not relevant by the Reference Court. The SLAO had relied upon the sale deed at Serial No.43 in which the land admeasuring 0.094 acres had been sold by a registered sale deed on 10th June, 1991 for a sum of `92,000 giving the value of the land at the rate of `9,78,732.40 per acre, and determined the market value 18 of the land acquired at that rate. When the matter came up before the Reference Court for consideration, in all other references except Reference No. 121 of 1994 titled as Chamel Singh v. Collector, Dehradun, the Reference Court had relied upon the two sale instances produced by the claimants and awarded compensation at the rate of ` 5,12,000 per bigha which was later reduced by the High Court to ` 4,26,667 per bigha. In the case of Chamel Singh (supra), the Reference Court rejected these two sale instances at serial Nos. 109 and 110 as vendor or vendee had not been examined. It also noticed the allegation of the State that those sale deeds were not bona fide and have been executed only with the intention to enhance the value of the acquired land and as such declined to rely on them in its judgment. The Reference Court in that case also rejected the reliance placed by SLAO upon sale deed at serial No. 43 for determining the market value of acquired land and instead relied upon the sale instance at serial No. 108 where the land admeasuring about 0.90 acres was sold on 29th November, 1991 at the rate of ` 12,55,550.50 per acre. After discussing the evidence at some detail, the 19 Reference Court awarded the compensation to the claimants at the rate of `12,50,000 per acre without making any deduction from such market value. In appeal the High Court, however, applied a deduction of 33.33% and awarded compensation to the claimants at the rate of ` 8,33,334 per acre. From the above factual matrix the first question that requires consideration of this Court is whether the Reference Court was justified in law with reference to the facts on record in declining to consider the two sale instances produced by the claimants at serial Nos. 109 and 110. In other words, was it justified on part of the Reference Court to keep them outside the zone of consideration while determining the market value of the acquired land? 13. Firstly, it cannot be disputed that both the seller and the purchaser in sale instances at serial Nos. 109 and 110 are either claimants in different claim petitions or belong to the same family. The sale deed is stated to be executed by Sh. Viresh Jain in favour of Jitender Kumar Jain and Smt. Veena Kumari Jain (sister of Sh. Viresh Jain). 20 Veena Kumari Jain has described herself as wife of M. Kumar who appears to be Sh. Manoj Kumar Jain, who was examined as a witness as he was a Member of the Selection Committee dealing with the acquisition of the land for the purpose of construction of Government Polytechnic Institute. In his examination he admitted that he was brother-in-law of Sh. Viresh Jain. As a member of that Committee he had a definite role to play in selection of the land for that purpose. In other words, the claimants had full knowledge of acquisition of land and as well as the purpose for which the said land was sought to be acquired. With respect we reiterate the view expressed by this Court in the case of Yeshwant Deorao Deshmukh v. Walchand Ramchand Kothari [(1950) 1 SCR 852] that a fraudulent move or design is not capable of direct proof in most cases; it can only be inferred. Under such circumstances, the Court has to take a general view keeping in mind the facts and circumstances of the case with particular reference to the intent of parties, their action in furtherance thereto and the object sought to be achieved by them. 14. It is not in dispute that these sale deeds have been 21 executed in favour of the family members or persons known to the claimants. These are circumstances and evidence which clearly indicate that the sale instances relied upon by the claimants are result of collusion between these parties. There was clear attempt on the part of the claimants to execute sale deeds for the purpose of hiking up land price just before acquisition to get more compensation. These two sale instances which have been executed just about two months prior to the issuance of the notification under Section 4(1) stand out as transactions which are sham, collusive, lack bona fide and have been executed with the intention to raise the price of the land in question with the pretence of it being actual market value. We are unable to find any infirmity in this view of the Reference Court in LA Case No. 121 of 1994 which has rightly been upheld by the High Court. 15. It will be appropriate at this stage to notice that in C.A. Nos. 7498-99 of 2005 a specific ground has been taken by the State that the High Court erred in not considering the application of State filed under Order XLI Rule 27 of the Code of Civil Procedure , 1908 during pendency of First 22 Appeal Nos. 920 and 921 of 2000 to lead additional evidence to show that the sale deeds relied upon by the Reference Court in LA Case No. 386 of 1993 and accepted by the High Court were collusive and the claimants had prior knowledge of the impending acquisition proceedings. This additional evidence is basically related to the facts which have already been mentioned by us while discussing the facts of C.A No. 3613 of 2008. In that application, it was specifically stated that Smt. Veena Kumari is sister of one of the claimants, i.e. Viresh Jain and she is wife of Manoj Kumar Jain, who was member of the Selection Committee aforereferred and these facts had duly been verified from the local police station vide letter dated 11th September, 1996. However, this application appears to have been rejected by the High Court without recording any appropriate reasons in support thereof. In view of the peculiar fact that the Reference Court, in its award in L.A. Case No. 121 of 1994 which is subject matter before us in C.A. No. 3613 of 2008, has noticed this entire evidence in great detail, it can hardly be contended that the application has rightly been rejected by the High Court. In our opinion, 23 the High Court should have allowed this application particularly when the entire evidence sought to be produced by way of additional evidence challenged the very basis of the judgment of the High Court. In view of these peculiar facts we need not discuss this issue at any greater length and according to us the facts stated in that application can be examined by this Court as they are already part of the judicial record in C.A. No. 3613 of 2008, which has been listed for hearing along with other appeals and all these appeals have been heard together. 16. Corollary to the discussion under this head is the question that whether the Reference Court, in LA Case No. 121 of 1994, was right in law in rejecting the two sale instances for the reason that vendor or vendee had not been examined to prove them in Court and thus these sale instances were inadmissible in evidence. While recording such a finding the Reference Court had relied upon the judgment of this Court in the case of A.P. State Road Transport Corporation, Hyderabad v. P. Venkaiah , [(1997) 10 SCC 128]. This issue need not detain us any further as it is no longer res integra that the judgment of this Court in the 24 above case has been overruled by a Constitution Bench of this Court in the case of Cement Corporation of India v. Purya , [(2004) 8 SCC 270]. Thus, in our view, these two sale instances cannot be rejected on that ground after the dictum of the Constitution Bench in the above case . Though, this observation is subject to the other findings recorded by us in this judgment. 17. A Bench of this Court in the case of Chimanlal Hargovinddas (supra) stated that the Court while tackling the problem of valuation of the land under acquisition should necessarily make some general observations. Explaining the factors, which must be etched on the mental screen while performing such exercise, this Court specifically held, ""only genuine instances have to be taken into consideration (sometimes instances are rigged up in anticipation of acquisition of land)"". Further, this Court in the case of State of Haryana v. Ram Singh [(2001) 6 SCC 254], has reiterated this principle and held, ""It is open to the Court to accept the certified copy as the reliable evidence and without examining parties to the documents. This does not however, preclude the Court from rejecting 25 the transaction itself as being malafide or sham provided such a challenge is already before the Court"". Question No. III 18. The law with regard to applying the principle of deduction to the determined market value of the acquired land is quite consistent, though, of course, the extent of deduction has varied very widely depending on the facts and circumstances of a given case. In other words, it is not possible to state precisely the exact deduction which could be made uniformly applicable to all the cases. Normally the rule stated by this Court consistently, in its different judgments, is that deduction is to be applied on account of carrying out development activities like providing roads or civic amenities such as electricity, water etc. when the land has been acquired for construction of residential, commercial or institutional projects. It shall also be applied where the sale instances (exemplars) relate to smaller pieces of land and in comparison the acquisition relates to a large tract of land. In addition thereto, deduction can also be applied on account of wastage of land. This Court in the case of Land Acquisition Officer, 26 Kammarapally Village v. Nookala Rajamallu [(2003) 12 SCC 334], had also observed that it is advisable to apply some deduction on account of exemplars of plots of smaller size relied upon by way of evidence by the parties. This is the normal rule stated by the Court but is not free of exceptions. 19. Similarly, it is neither possible nor appropriate to stricto sensu define a class of cases where the Court would not apply any deduction. This again would be dependant upon the facts and circumstances of a given case. The cases where the acquired land itself is fully developed and has all essential amenities, before acquisition, for the purpose for which it is acquired requiring no additional expenditure for its development, falls under the purview of cases of `no deduction'. Furthermore, where the evidence led by the parties is of such instances where the compensation paid is comparable, i.e. exemplar lands have all the features comparable to the proposed acquired land, including that of size, is another category of cases where principle of `no deduction' may be applied. These may be the cases where least or no deduction could be made. 27 Such cases are exceptional and/or rare as normally the lands which are proposed to be acquired for development purposes would be agricultural lands and/or semi or haphazardly developed lands at the time of issuance of notification under Section 4(1) of the Act, which is the relevant time to be taken into consideration for all purposes and intents for determining the market value of the land in question. 20. This Court in the case of Bhagwathula Samanna & Ors v. Special Tahsildar & Land Acquisition Officer , [(1991) 4 SCC 506], stated that it is permissible to take into account of exemplars of even small developed plots for determining value of a large tract of land acquired, if the latter is also fully developed with all facilities requiring little or no further development. In the facts and circumstances of that case the Court felt that it was not appropriate to resort to deduction of 1/3rd value of the comparable sale instances as development charges. The Court reiterated the general rule that if market value of a large property is to be fixed on the basis of a sale transaction for smaller property, a deduction is to be made taking into 28 consideration the expenses required for development of that larger tract and make smaller plots within that area and held as under : ""8. In awarding compensation in acquisition proceedings, the Court has necessarily to determine the market value of the land as on the date of the relevant Notification. It is useful to consider the value paid for similar land at the material time under genuine transactions. The market value envisages the price which a willing purchaser may pay under bona fide transfer to a willing seller. The land value can differ depending upon the extent and nature of the land sold. A fully developed small plot in an important locality may fetch a higher value than a larger area in an undeveloped condition and situated in a remote locality. By comparing the price shown in the transactions all variables have to be taken into consideration. The transaction in regard to smaller property cannot, therefore, be taken as a real basis for fixing the compensation for larger tracts of property. In fixing the market value of a large property on the basis of a sale transaction for smaller property, generally a deduction is given taking into consideration the expenses required for development of the larger tract to make smaller plots within that area in order to compare with the small plots dealt with under the sale transaction. This principle has been stated by this Court in Tribeni Devi's case (supra). 11. The principle of deduction in the land 29 value covered by the comparable sale is thus adopted in order to arrive at the market value of the acquired land. In applying the principle it is necessary to consider all relevant facts. It is not the extent of the area covered under the acquisition, the only relevant factor. Even in the vast area there may be land which is fully developed having all amenities and situated in an advantageous position. If smaller area within the large tract is already developed and suitable for building purposes and have in its vicinity roads, drainage, electricity, communications etc. then the principle of deduction simply for the reason that it is part of the large tract acquired, may not be justified. 13. The proposition that large area of land cannot possibly fetch a price at the same rate at which small plots are sold is not absolute proposition and in given circumstances it would be permissible to take into account the price fetched by the small plots of land. If the larger tract of land because of advantageous position is capable of being used for the purpose for which the smaller plots are used and is also situated in a developed area with little or no requirement of further development, the principle of deduction of the value for purpose of comparison is not warranted."" It is thus evident from the above enunciated principle that the acquired land has to be more or less developed land as its developed surrounding areas, with all amenities 30 and facilities and is fit to be used for the purpose for which it is acquired without any further expenditure, before such land could be considered for no deduction. Similarly the sale instances even of smaller plots could be considered for determining the market value of a larger chunk of land with some deduction unless, there was comparability in potential, utilisation, amenities and infrastructure with hardly any distinction. On such principles each case would have to be considered on its own merits. 21. This Court, depending on the facts and circumstances of each given case, has taken the view that deduction on account of expenses of development of the sites could vary from 10% to 86.33% depending on the nature of the land, its situation, the purpose and stage of development. Reference can be made to the cases of K.S. Shivadevamma v. Assistant Commissioner and Land Acqusition Officer [( 1996) 2 SCC 62], Ram Piari v. Land Acquisition Collector , Solan [(1996) 8 SCC 338], Chimanlal Hargovinddas v. Special Land Acquisition Officer, Poona [( 1988) 3 SCC 751], Hasanali Walimchand (Dead) by L` v. 31 State of Maharashtra [(1998) 2 SCC 388]. In K.S. Shivadevamma (supra), this Court held as under: ""10. It is then contended that 53% is not automatic but depends upon the nature of the development and the stage of development. We are inclined to agree with the learned counsel that the extent of deduction depends upon development need in each case. Under the Building Rules 53% of land is required to be left out. This Court has laid as a general rule that for laying the roads and other amenities 33-1/3% is required to be deducted. Where the development has already taken place, appropriate deduction needs to be made. In this case, we do not find any development had taken place as on that date. When we are determining compensation under Section 23(1) , as on the date of notification under Section 4(1) , we have to consider the situation of the land development, if already made, and other relevant facts as on that date. No doubt, the land possessed potential value, but no development had taken place as on the date, In view of the obligation on the part of the owner to hand over the land to the City Improvement Trust for roads and for other amenities and his requirement to expend money for laying the roads, water supply mains, electricity etc., the deduction of 53% and further deduction towards development charges @ 33- 1/3%, ordered by the High Court, was 32 not illegal."" Thus, a deduction of 53% was given on account of Building Rules and a further deduction of 33.33% on account of development charges on the fact of that case, amounting to a total of 86.33% deduction. The above view was reiterated in the case of Nookala Rajamallu (supra). 22. On similar lines, this Court in the case of V. Hanumantha Reddy (Deceased) by L` v. Land Acquisition Officer & Mandal R. Officer [(2003) 12 SCC 642], while considering that the acquired land was adjacent to developed land, held that neither its high potentiality nor its proximity to a developed land can be a ground for not deducting the development charges and that normally 1/3rd deduction could be allowed. 23. Though in the case of Bhagwathula Samanna (supra) referring to the peculiar facts of the case, this Court observed that it was not necessary to make any deduction, the consistent view taken by this Court is that normally deduction has to be made. In the cases above mentioned 33 this Court has directed to make deduction ranging from 20% to 86.33%. 24. The learned Counsel for the claimants relied upon the judgment of this Court in the case of Atma Singh v. State of Haryana [(2008) 2 SCC 568], to contend that even if exemplars of small plots are tendered in evidence, the deduction cannot be more than 10%. He contended that the Reference Court as well as the High Court both have fallen in error of law in applying the deduction of 20% and 33.33% respectively. In this judgment, this Court clearly observed that the price fetched for small plots cannot form safe basis for valuation of large tracts of land as substantial area is used for development of sites by providing various facilities for which expenses are also incurred; such amount, which normally would vary from 20% onwards depending upon the facts of each case, should be deducted. However , in that case the land had been acquired for setting up a sugar factory which, for its efficient running, may also require part of the land to be used for construction of residential colonies for the staff working in the factory. The sugar factory that was sought to be constructed on the 34 acquired land was to carry on its business to make profits. The Court noticed that earlier the by-products of a sugar factory like molasses were treated as waste and its disposal itself was a problem. However, with the passage of time and scientific developments, such by- products are being used for production of Alcohol and Ethanol which added to the profits. It was in these circumstances that Court was of the view that it was not a case for higher deduction and discounted only 10% from the determined market value of the acquired land. Thus the claimants cannot derive any advantage to contend that there should not be any deduction in this case. Reliance by them was also placed upon the judgment of this Court in the case of Charan Dass v. Himachal Pradesh Housing & Urban Development Authority [(2010) 13 SCC 398]. In that case the Court was concerned with the question that whether deduction of 40% from the market value determined by the High Court towards development charges was justified or not. This Court held that where the acquired land falls in the amidst of an already developed land with amenities of roads, electricity etc., deduction on this account may not be 35 warranted. At the same time it also held that where all civic and other amenities are yet to be provided to make the land suitable for building purposes or when under the local building regulations setting apart some portion of the lands for sanctioning common facilities is mandatory, an appropriate deduction may be justified. Referring to the facts of that case, this Court permitted deduction of 30% as development charges from the market value of the land. 25. In the present case, there is evidence on record to show that plotting has been done only on part of the acquired land and the land is surrounded by colonies like ITBP etc. but, there is no evidence to show that the acquired land itself is developed and is having all the required facilities and amenities. It may be a case where less deduction may be applied but certainly it is not a case of `no deduction'. It also cannot be believed, in the absence of specific documentary evidence, that no further development is required on the acquired land. The claimants, on whom the onus lies to prove inadequacy of compensation have not even stated that whether under the relevant laws they are expected to leave any part of their 36 land open when they are permitted to raise construction on the land in question. Under these circumstances, we are unable to find any infirmity in the approach of the High Court in applying the principle of deduction. In our opinion a deduction of 10% from the market value on account of development charges and other possible expenditures would be justifiable and called for in the facts and circumstances of the present case. Question No. IV: Determination of Compensation Application of principle of guesstimate for determining the amount of compensation to be awarded for the land acquired under the Act 26. Acquisition of land is an act falling in the purview of eminent domain of the State. It essentially relates to the concept of compulsory acquisition as opposed to voluntary sale. It is trite that no person can be deprived of his property save by authority of law in terms of Article 300A of the Constitution of India. The provisions of the Act provide a complete mechanism for `deprivation of property in accordance with the law' as stated under the Act. 37 Justifiability and fairness of such compensation is subject to judicial review within the confines of the four corners of the Act. Once the lands are acquired under the Act, the persons interested therein are entitled to compensation as per the provisions of the Act. Thus, in the present case the land in question has been acquired under the provisions of a law which specifically provide that acquisition can only be for a public purpose and upon payment of compensation to the claimants in accordance with law. The compensation payable to the claimants has to be computed in terms of Sections 23 and 24 of the Act. The market value of the land has to be determined at the date of the publication of the notification under Section 4(1) of the Act, after taking into consideration what is stated under Sections 23(1) , 23(1A) , 23(2) and excluding the considerations stated under Section 24 of the Act. More often than not, it is not possible to fix the compensation with exactitude or arithmetic accuracy. Depending on the facts and circumstances of the case, the Court may have to take recourse to some guesswork while determining the fair market value of the land and the consequential amount of compensation that is required to 38 be paid to the persons interested in the acquired land. 27. `Guess' as understood in its common parlance is an estimate without any specific information while `calculations' are always made with reference to specific data. `Guesstimate' is an estimate based on a mixture of guesswork and calculations and it is a process in itself. At the same time `guess' cannot be treated synonymous to `conjecture'. `Guess' by itself may be a statement or result based on unknown factors while `conjecture' is made with a very slight amount of knowledge, which is just sufficient to incline the scale of probability. `Guesstimate' is with higher certainty than mere `guess' or a `conjecture' per se. 28. The concept of `guesswork' is not unknown to various fields of law. It has been applied in cases relating to insurance, taxation, compensation under the Motor Vehicles Act as well as under the Labour Laws. All that is required from a Court is that such guesswork has to be used with greater element of caution and within the determinants of law declared by the Legislature or by the Courts from time to time. In the case of Charan Dass (supra) this Court on the use of guesswork for determining 39 compensation, has held as under:- ""10. Section 15 of the Act mandates that in determining the amount of compensation, the Collector shall be guided by the provisions contained in Sections 23 and 24 of the Act. Section 23 provides that in determining the amount of compensation to be awarded for the land acquired under the Act, the Court shall, inter alia, take into consideration the market value of the land at the date of the publication of the Notification under Section 4 of the Act. The Section contains the list of positive factors and Section 24 has a list of negatives, vis-a-vis the land under acquisition, to be taken into consideration while determining the amount of compensation. As already noted, the first step being the determination of the market value of the land on the date of publication of Notification under Sub-section (1) of Section 4 of the Act. One of the principles for determination of the market value of the acquired land would be the price that a willing purchaser would be willing to pay if it is sold in the open market at the time of issue of Notification under Section 4 of the Act. But finding direct evidence in this behalf is not an easy task and, therefore, the Court has to take recourse to other known methods for arriving at the market value of the land acquired. One of the preferred and well accepted methods adopted for ascertaining the market value of the land in acquisition cases is the sale 40 transactions on or about the date of issue of Notification under Section 4 of the Act. But here again finding a transaction of sale on or a few days before the said Notification is not an easy exercise. In the absence of such evidence contemporaneous transactions in respect of the lands, which have similar advantages and disadvantages is considered as a good piece of evidence for determining the market value of the acquired land. It needs little emphasis that the contemporaneous transactions or the comparable sales have to be in respect of lands which are contiguous to the acquired land and are similar in nature and potentiality. Again, in the absence of sale deeds, the judgments and awards passed in respect of acquisition of lands, made in the same village and/or neighbouring villages can be accepted as valid piece of evidence and provide a sound basis to work out the market value of the land after suitable adjustments with regard to positive and negative factors enumerated in Sections 23 and 24 of the Act. Undoubtedly, an element of some guess work is involved in the entire exercise, yet the authority charged with the duty to award compensation is bound to make an estimate judged by an objective standard. (emphasis supplied) 41 29. Even in the case of Thakur Kamta Prasad Singh (Dead) through LRs v. State of Bihar [(1976) 3 SCC 772], this Court had held that there is an element of guesswork inherent in most cases involving determination of the market value of the acquired land and observed as under: ""6. Section 23 of the Act provides that in determining the amount of compensation to be awarded for land acquisition under the Act the court shall inter alia take into consideration the market value of the land at the date of the publication of the notification under Section 4 of the Act. Market value means the price that a willing purchaser would pay to a willing seller for the property having due regard to its existing condition with all its existing advantages and its potential possibilities when laid out in the most advantageous manner excluding any advantages due to the carrying out of the scheme for which the property is compulsorily acquired. In considering market value the disinclination of the vendor to part with his land and the urgent necessity of the purchaser to buy should be disregarded. There is an element of guesswork inherent in most cases involving determination of the market value of the acquired land, but this in the very nature of things cannot be helped. The essential thing is to keep in view the relevant factors prescribed by the Act. If the judgment of the High Court reveals that it has taken into consideration the relevant factors, its assessment of the fair market value of the acquired land should not be disturbed. No such infirmity has been brought to our notice as might induce us 42 to disturb the finding of the High Court. The appeal consequently fails and is dismissed but in the circumstances without costs."" 30. Similar view was taken by another Bench of this Court in the case of Special Land Acquisition Officer v. Karigowda [(2010) 5 SCC 708] where this Court held, ""the Court is entitled to apply some amount of reasonable guesswork to balance the equities and fix a just and fair market value in terms of the parameters specified under Section 23 of the Act."" 31. The observations made by this Court in a case under the Central Excise Valuation Rules, 1975 titled as Commissioner of Central Excise, Jaipur v. Rajasthan Spinning and Weaving Mills Ltd. [2007 (12) SCR 703], can be aptly referred to at this stage wherein this Court had held that valuation is not an exact science and some amount of guesswork exists in valuation. Different methods for valuation are prescribed by Valuation Rules which may be applied by the Department but it has to be ultimately ascertained by applying the rule of convergence, the estimated ad valorem value of which would constitute the 43 base of the assessable value. 32. Under the Act , as settled by various judgments of this Court, there are different methods of computation of compensation payable to the claimants, for example it can be based upon comparable sale instances, awards and judgments relating to the similar or comparable lands, method of averages, yearly yields with reference to the revenue earned by the land etc. Whatever method of determining the compensation is applied by the court, its result should always be reasonable, just and fair as that is the purpose sought to be achieved under the scheme of the Act. For attaining that purpose, application of some guesswork may be necessary but this principle would have hardly any application in a case of no evidence. In other words, where the parties have not brought on record any evidence, then the court will not be in a position to award compensation merely on the basis of imagination, conjecture etc. 33. These precedents clearly demonstrate that the Court may apply some guesswork before it could arrive at a final determination, which is in consonance with the 44 statutory law as well as the principles stated in the judicial pronouncements. As already noticed, the guesswork has to be used for determination of compensation with greater element of caution and the principle of guesstimation will have no application to the case of `no evidence'. This principle is only intended to bridge the gap between the calculated compensation and the actual compensation that the claimants may be entitled to receive as per the facts of a given case to meet the ends of justice. It will be appropriate for us to state certain principles controlling the application of `guesstimate: (a) Wherever the evidence produced by the parties is not sufficient to determine the compensation with exactitude, this principle can be resorted to. (b) Discretion of the court in applying guesswork to the facts of a given case is not unfettered but has to be reasonable and should have a connection to the data on record produced by the parties by way of evidence. Further, this entire exercise has to be within the limitations specified under Sections 23 and 24 of the Act and cannot be made in detriment thereto. 45 34. Applying these principles to the facts of the present case, we have to take recourse to the `principle of guesstimation' inasmuch as it is essential for fixation of fair market value of the land which shall be the basis for determining the compensation payable to the claimants. Now, we will discuss the evidence led by the parties in that behalf. 35. All the claimants in the present appeals have primarily relied upon the sale instances shown at serial Nos. 109 and 110. These sale instances were not relied upon by the SLAO while making the award and were also rejected by the Reference Court in LA Case No.121 of 1994. This view of the Reference Court was upheld by the High Court vide its judgment in First Appeal Nos. 60-63 of 2001 which is subject matter of the appeal before this Court in C.A. No. 3613 of 2008. We have already noticed that as per these sale instances the value of the land comes to a rate of ` 32,72,603 and ` 34,87,648 per acre respectively. While accepting the concurrent view of the Reference Court and the High Court subject matter of CA No. 3613 of 2008, we 46 have already held that these sale instances are liable to be ignored and have rightly been ignored by the Courts below. Besides the fact that these sale deeds are executed between the members of the family, the claimants had full knowledge of the Government's intention to acquire these lands, for the purpose specified, even prior to issuance of notification under Section 4(1) of the Act through Mr. M.K. Jain. These are reasons enough to doubt the consideration paid in these sale deeds. 36. The SLAO, in his Award, has taken note of 140 sale instances immediately preceding the issuance of Notification under Section 4(1) of the Act. The Reference Court, in LA Case No. 121 of 1994, specifically recorded that the highest value reflected in these 140 sale instances is ` 12,55,550.50 per acre, except in sale instances at serial Nos. 109 and 110 produced by the claimants. It is interesting to note that the claimants did not produce any other evidence except these two sale instances which had been executed between the members of the family and contained unreasonably high price of the land. There is tremendous gap between the prices of the land fetched in all 47 other sale deeds on one hand, the highest being ` 12,55,550.50 per acre and that in sale deeds executed by the claimants between themselves on the other hand which is ` 34,87,648 per acre, for sales effected within a span of 2- 3 days for similarly situated lands in the same village. It certainly arouses suspicion in the mind of the Court as to the intention behind execution of these sale deeds. Ex facie they appear to have been executed to hike up the price of the land just before the issuance of Notification under Section 4(1) of the Act. If considered from the point of view of a reasonable man, all these circumstances clearly fall beyond the ambit of coincidence and appear to have been `managed' to achieve the end of receiving higher compensation. In light of these facts and the reasons already recorded, we have no hesitation in holding that the sale instances at serial Nos. 109 and 110 produced by the claimants are liable to be ignored for the purposes of fixation of market value of the acquired land as these transactions are sham and lack bona fide. 37. The SLAO, in his award had relied upon sale instance shown at serial No. 43 and had therefore 48 determined the market value of the land at the rate of ` 9,78,723.40 per acre (i.e. ` 1,86,423.50 per bigha approximately). The compensation awarded on the basis of the above market value and by applying belting system was not accepted by the Reference Court. The Reference Court in LA Case No. 121 of 1994, instead relied upon sale deed at serial No. 108 where the land was sold at the rate of ` 12,55,550.50 per acre on 29th November, 1991, i.e. even subsequent to the sale instances relied upon by the claimants. The Reference Court had therefore awarded compensation at the rate of ` 12,50,000 per acre which was reduced by the High Court to `8 ,33,334 after applying a deduction of 33.33%. 38. The Reference Court, in LA Case Nos. 386 of 1993, had determined the market value of the land at a rate of ` 6,40,000 per bigha (i.e. ` 33,60,000 per acre approximately) and after applying a deduction of 20% awarded compensation at the rate of ` 5,12,000 per bigha. This was reduced further by the High Court by increasing the deduction from 20% to 33.33% and therefore awarding a 49 sum of ` 4,26,667 per bigha (i.e. ` 22,40,001.80 per acre) as compensation. The two exhibits produced by the claimants were the sole basis for awarding compensation to the claimants in this line of cases. These exhibits offend the very essence of the parameters stated under Section 23 of the Act as defined by this Court in the case of Ram Singh (supra). Thus, the view taken by the Reference Court and the High Court, which is subject matter of C.A. No. 3613 of 2008, rejecting these instances as collusive and sham is liable to be sustained. 39. The judgment of the Reference Court and that of the High Court in these cases, accepting the sale instances under serial Nos. 109 and 110, cannot be sustained in law and is liable to be set aside. However, as it appears from the record the earlier judgments of the Division Benches of the High Court in First Appeal Nos. 920-921 of 2001, dated 20th July, 2005, and in First Appeal Nos. 918-919 of 2001, dated 09th March, 2006 were not brought to the notice of the Division Bench of the High Court which pronounced the judgments in First Appeal Nos. 60-63 of 2001, dated 11th May, 2006. 50 40. Now, after we have rejected the sale instances at serial Nos. 109 and 110, we have to consider what compensation the claimants are entitled to receive in accordance with other evidence on record. The sale instance shown at serial No. 108 is certainly an exemplar which can be taken into consideration. This is a sale deed executed on 29th November, 1991 where a land admeasuring 0.90 acres has been sold at a rate of ` 12,55,550.50 per acre. As far as the location and potential of this land is concerned, we may refer straightaway to the award of the Reference Court, in LA Case No. 121 of 1994, where it referred to the statement of PW1, Sh. Gyan Swarup, stating that the land which was subject matter of this sale deed is situated at a distance of 1= furlong of the acquired land in the same village. It is the case of the claimants in all these appeals that the acquired land is surrounded by developed areas like ITBP Colony on the North and there was a 20 feet wide passage ending on the acquired land. Facilities of post office, electricity, hospital, schools etc. were available in those colonies which are very close to the acquired land. The Reference Courts, in their respective awards, have also 51 noticed that heavy construction activity was going on nearby Shimla Road and the value of this land is continuously rising. 41. Another relevant piece of evidence with reference to potential and location of the land is the statement of PW-4 Girdhari Lal Arora, noticed in the judgment of the Reference Court in L.A. Case No. 386 if 1993, who is an Architect by profession. He claims to have visited the site and made plans to divide the land in question into plots after making provision for civic amenities, children park etc. In these circumstances, it is difficult to doubt that the land in question has substantial potential and is located adjacent to developed areas. He further stated, ""In the year 1992 the value of the land around, the acquired land was ` six to 6.50 lacs per bigha and thereafter there had been a slump in the prices of the land"". Statement of this witness has to be given its due value as nothing controversial appears to have come in evidence in his cross-examination. According to this witness, there has been a decreasing trend in the value of the land in that area. The declaration under Section 6 was issued in April, 1992 itself at a time when the 52 prices had started falling. 42. The cumulative effect of the documentary and oral evidence on record is that it is a case of acquisition of land which is situated on a reasonably good location surrounded by developed areas having civic amenities and facilities and further development activity was going on in nearby areas. It was also submitted by the claimants that plotting has already been done on the acquired land and some plots of land have been sold immediately prior to the issuance of the Notification under Section 4(1) of the Act. It is evident that the land acquired had the potential of being developed for residential or institutional purposes and as already noticed, the same was acquired for construction of a Government Polytechnic Institute. Therefore, it is a case where the Court should apply minimal deduction which will meet the ends of justice and would help in determining just and fair compensation for the land in question. We are of the considered view that 10% deduction from the market value of the acquired land would meet the ends of justice. 43. It is not in dispute before us that sale instance at serial No. 108 falls in the Revenue Estate of the same 53 Village and as recorded by the Reference Court, in LA Case No. 121 of 1994, it is situated at a distance of 1= furlong from the acquired land. The acquired land belonging to the claimants forms part of Khasra No.39/2 while, in the same Reveue Estate, the sale instance at serial No. 108 is part of Khasra No. 410. Thus a sale deed related to a land in such proximity of time and distance cannot be said to be incomparable sale instance, i.e. it has to be taken as a comparable sale instance. Though it relates to the sale of a smaller plot of land but is certainly bigger than the land sold by the claimants between themselves. Its location and potential, if not identical in absolute terms, is certainly comparable for the purposes of determining market value of the land in question. It is a well established principle that the value of sale of small pieces of land can be taken into consideration for determining even the value of a large tract of land but with a rider that the Court while taking such instances into consideration has to make some deduction keeping in view other attendant circumstances and facts of that particular case. We have already held that keeping in view the surrounding developed areas and location and 54 potential of the land it will meet the ends of justice if 10% deduction is made from the estimated market value of the acquired land. 44. The comparable sale instance under serial No. 108 depicted the fair value of land in that area at the time of issuance of Notification under Section 4(1) of the Act which is ` 12,55,550.50 per acre. The time gap between this sale instance and issuance of said Notification is merely two months which would hardly call for any increase in the said value but to balance the equities between the parties we would round off the figure to ` 13,00,000 per acre. By applying the principle of guesstimate, thus, we determine the market value of the acquired land at ` 13,00,000 per acre as on the date of the issuance of the Notification under Section 4(1) of the Act. Deducting 10% therefrom, it would come to ` 11,70,000 per acre which will be the compensation payable to the claimants with statutory benefits and interests thereupon in accordance with law. 45. Ergo, for the reasons aforerecorded, we pass the 55 following orders in the appeals, subject matter of the present judgment : (i) The Civil Appeal No. 3613 of 2008, the appeal preferred by the claimants Krishna Devi and Others, is partially accepted and the judgment of the High Court impugned in this appeal is modified to the extent that the claimants would be entitled to receive compensation at the rate of ` 11,70,000 per acre with interests and other statutory benefits permissible under the law. (ii) Civil Appeal Nos. 7498-7499 of 2005 preferred by the State of Uttaranchal are partially accepted and the compensation payable to the claimants is reduced from ` 22,40,001.80 per acre to ` 11,70,000 per acre. The claimants would be entitled to interest and all statutory benefits permissible under the law. (iii) Civil Appeal No. 1122 of 2011 preferred by the State of Uttaranchal is partially accepted and the compensation 56 payable to the claimants is reduced from ` 22,40,001.80 per acre to ` 11,70,000 per acre. The claimants would be entitled to interest and all statutory benefits permissible under the law. (iv) Civil appeal Nos. 7496-7497 of 2005 preferred by the other claimants are dismissed without any order as to costs. ................................................J.

"Yomeshbhai Pranshankar Bhatt vs State Of Gujarat on 19 May, 2011","2109","YOMESHBHAI PRANSHANKAR BHATT Appellant (s) VERSUS STATE OF GUJARAT Respondent(s) J U D G M E N T GANGULY, J. Heard learned counsel for the parties. Some important questions have come up for consideration in this case. This appeal is against the concurrent finding of both the courts convicting the appellant under Section 302 IPC and sentencing him to suffer imprisonment for life. The judgment of the Trial Court was rendered by the Additional Sessions Judge at Vadodara in Sessions Case No. 275 of 2001 by judgment and order dated 16.8.2001. The High Court by judgment and order dated 17.3.2009 in Criminal Appeal No. 815 of 2001 affirmed the same. At the stage of SLP, this Court by an order dated 27.7.2009 issued notice only confined to the question as to 1 whether the petitioner is guilty for commission of an offence under any of the parts of Section 304 of the Indian Penal Code and not under Section 302 thereof. Learned counsel for the appellant urged that though at the time of issuing notice, this Court limited its rights to raise points only within the confines of Section 304 of Indian Penal Code, the Court is not bound at the time of final hearing with that direction given while issuing notice and the appellant is entitled to urge all questions including his right to urge that he should have been acquitted in the facts and circumstances of the case. Before examining the correctness of the aforesaid submission, we are inclined to look into the rules of this Court. The Supreme Court Rules, 1966 (hereinafter referred to as ""the rules"") which have been framed under Article 145 of the Constitution are relevant in connection with this inquiry. It has been held by this Court that the power of Supreme Court to make Rules to regulate its own procedure is only subject to two limitations: (i)These rules are subject to laws made by Parliament. [See Rodemadan India Ltd., v. International Trade Expo Centre Ltd. , (2006) 11 SCC 651.] (ii)These rules, being in the nature of subordinate legislation, cannot override the Constitutional provision. [See Prem Chand Garg and another v. Excise Commissioner, U.P. and others , AIR 1963 SC 996] However, these rules are intended to govern the practice and procedure of this Court. Article 145 of the Constitution provides that subject to the provisions of any law made by Parliament, the Supreme Court, 2 may from time to time, with the approval of the President, make rules for regulating the general practice and procedures of the court including the matters which are enumerated as follows:- (a) rules as to the persons practising before the Court; (b) rules as to the procedure for hearing appeals and other matters pertaining to appeals including the time within which appeals to the Court are to be entered; (c ) rules as to the proceedings in the Court for the enforcement of any of the rights conferred by Part III; (cc)[rules as to the proceedings in the Court under [ article 139A]; (d) rules as to the entertainment of appeals under sub-clause (c ) of clause (1) of article 134; (e) rules as to the conditions subject to which any judgment pronounced or order made by the Court may be reviewed and the procedure for such review including the time within which applications to the Court for such review are to be entered; (f) rules as to the costs of and incidental to any proceedings in the Court and as to the fees to be charged in respect of proceedings therein; (g) rules as to the granting of bail; (h) rules as to stay of proceedings; (i) rules providing for the summary determination of any appeal which appears to the Court to be frivolous or vexatious or brought for the purpose of delay; 3 We are not concerned here with other sub-articles of Article 145. The rules which have been thus framed by this Court under the constitutional provision must be read in understanding the scope of its power under Article 142 of the Constitution. Article 142 of the Constitution provides as follows:- 142. Enforcement of decrees and orders of Supreme Court and orders as to discovery, etc. (1) The Supreme Court in the exercise of its jurisdiction may pass such decree or make such order as is necessary for doing complete justice in any cause or matter pending before it, and any decree so passed or order so made shall be enforceable throughout the territory of India in such manner as may be prescribed by or under any law made by Parliament and, until provision in that behalf is so made, in such manner as the President may by order prescribed. 2. Subject to the provisions of any law made in this behalf by Parliament, the Supreme Court shall, as respects the whole of the territory of India, have all and every power to make any order for the purpose of securing the attendance of any person, the discovery or production of any documents, or the investigation or punishment of any contempt of itself. The provision of Article 142 of the Constitution have been construed by this Court in several judgments. However, one thing is clear that under Article 142 of the Constitution, this Court in exercise of its jurisdiction may pass such decrees and 4 may make such orders as is necessary for doing complete justice in any case or matters pending before it. It is, therefore, clear that the court while hearing the matter finally and considering the justice of the case may pass such orders which the justice of the case demands and in doing so, no fetter is imposed on the court's jurisdiction except of course any express provision of the law to the contrary, and normally this Court cannot ignore the same while exercising its power under Article 142. An order which was passed by the court at the time of admitting a petition does not have the status of an express provision of law. Any observation which is made by the court at the time of entertaining a petition by way of issuing notice are tentative observations. Those observations or orders cannot limit this court's jurisdiction under Article 142. If we look at the rules, it is also clear from the Order XLVII Rule 6, that the inherent powers of the Court are saved under the Rules. The provision of Order XLVII Rule 6 are set out to demonstrate the same. ""Nothing in these rules shall be deemed to limit or otherwise affect the inherent powers of the Court to make such orders as may be necessary for the ends of justice or to prevent abuse of the process of the Court."" Order XLVII Rule 1 is almost to the same effect and is set out below:- ""The Court may, for sufficient cause shown, excuse the parties from compliance with any of the requirements of these rules, and may give such 5 directions in matters of practice and procedure as it may consider just and expedient."" In view of this position under the rules and having regard to the constitutional provision under Article 142 , we do not think that this Court at the time of final hearing is precluded from considering the controversy in its entire perspective and in doing so, this Court is not inhibited by any observation in an order made at the time of issuing the notice. Observation to that effect has been made in a judgment of this Court in the case of State of Uttaranchal vs. Alok Sharma and others reported in 2009(7) SCC 647. In paragraph 31 at page 658, this Court, after making an express provision to Article 142 held as follows:- ""So far as civil appeal arising out of SLP(C) No. 6451 of 2005 and civil appeal arising out of SLP(C) no. 8239 of 2005 are concerned, although limited notice having been issued confining the case to back wages, but keeping in view the order passed in the other cases, we are of the opinion that the said order shall be recalled and leave on all points should be granted. The respondents being placed similarly should not, in our opinion, be treated differently. This order is being passed in exercise of our jurisdiction under Article 142 of the Constitution of India. However, we make it clear that if any amount has been paid to the said respondents, the same should not be recovered. The appeals are allowed with the aforementioned directions. No costs."" 6 By way of analogy we may refer to the provision of Section 100 of Civil Procedure Code. Section 100 runs as follows:- 100. Second Appeal. (1) Save as otherwise expressly provided in the body of this Code or by any other law for the time being in force, an appeal shall lie to the High Court from every decree passed in appeal by any Court subordinate to the High Court, if the High Court is satisfied that the case involves a substantial question of law. (2) An appeal may lie under this section from an appellate decree passed ex-parte. (3)In an appeal under this Section, the memorandum of appeal shall precisely state the substantial question of law involved in the appeal. (4)Where the High Court is satisfied that a substantial question of law is involved in any case, it shall formulate that question. (5)The appeal shall be heard on the question so formulated and the respondent shall, at the hearing of the appeal, be allowed to argue that the case does not involve such question: Provided that nothing in this sub-section shall be deemed to take away or abridge the power of the Court to hear, for reasons to be recorded, the appeal on any other substantial question of law, not formulated by it, if it is satisfied that the case involves such question. Proviso to Section 100 of the Code makes it clear that 7 the powers of High Court cannot be fettered to hear a second appeal on a question which was not formulated by it at the time of admitting a second appeal, if the case involves any other question. So far as the High Court is concerned, the same has been statutorily recognised under Section 100 in the case of Second Appeal. In the case of this Court, the same has been constitutionally provided in Article 142. We are, therefore, entitled to consider the plea of the appellant for acquittal despite the fact that at the time of issuing notice, it was limited in terms of the order dated 27.7.2009. We, however, make it clear that this cannot be a universal practice in all cases. The question whether the Court will enlarge the scope of its inquiry at the time of final hearing depends on the facts and circumstances of the case. Since in the facts of this case, we find that the appellant should be heard on all points, we have come to the aforesaid conclusion. Now, coming to the facts of the case, we find that broadly in the case against the appellant, there is no eye- witness. The facts are that the deceased was working in the house of the appellant as a maid. She was absent from her duties and the appellant went to her house, which is at a nearby area from the house of the appellant, to call her to join her duties as a maid. It is nobody's case that the appellant went to the house of the deceased, being armed with any weapon or he was carrying any inflammable substance. Therefore, any pre-meditation on the part of the appellant in causing any bodily harm or injury to the deceased is admittedly ruled out. 8 The appellant went to the house of the deceased being accompanied by one Alpesh. In the house of the deceased, an altercation ensued between the appellant and the deceased as the deceased was refusing to come and join her work as a maid presumably on the ground that the amount of Rs. 375/- per month which was paid by the appellant to the deceased by way of remuneration was very low. The appellant had stated by way of defence that the deceased had taken a loan of Rs. 10,000 from the appellant and the appellant wanted the deceased to return the same. However, this defence has not been accepted either by the trial court or the High Court. Admittedly, an altercation followed and it is alleged that the appellant on the spur of the moment, went to the deceased and gagged her mouth. The further prosecution case is that the deceased was cooking at the time when the appellant went to her house. A can of kerosene was lying nearby and the appellant almost emptied the can of kerosene on the deceased and lit the match stick. Surprisingly, Alpesh who accompanied the appellant to the house of the deceased ran away before the incident of burning had taken place and he was not examined by the prosecution at all. The only two other witnesses in this case are PW 1 husband of the deceased and PW 2 the elder sister-in-law of the deceased. PW 2 came to the place of occurrence after hearing the shouts of the deceased and made arrangements for taking the deceased to the doctor for treatment. Both PW 1 husband of the deceased and PW 2 Kanta Ben, who made arrangements for taking the deceased for medical treatment were declared hostile. PW 1, the husband of the deceased, in his evidence submitted that the deceased had suicidal tendencies in the past. The case is, therefore, entirely based on circumstantial evidence and the statement of the deceased in more than one dying declarations. The first dying declaration appears to have been 9 recorded when PW 2 Kanta Ben took the deceased to hospital at 0330 hours wherein the doctor said that the deceased was fully conscious and had informed the doctor that the appellant had sprinkled kerosene on her at 0200 hours at her residence when she was doing her work and set her on fire with a match stick. The second was recorded by PSI which is Exh. 27 and the third one was by the Executive Magistrate (Exh. 31). Virtually, there is no inconsistency between these dying declarations of the deceased recorded at the interval of few hours on the day of the incident. The prosecution evidence is that the deceased survived for six days after the date of the incident and lost her consciousness and did not regain her consciousness till she was alive. The evidence of PW 1 is that he was informed of the incident and he came to see the deceased on the date of the incident and found her unconscious. The learned counsel for the appellant further submitted the doctor had not given his written opinion that the deceased was fit enough to give her statement. Though orally, the doctor said so. Relying on this part of the evidence especially the evidence of the husband of the deceased, the learned counsel for the appellant submitted that even though the husband may have been declared hostile, the law relating to appreciation of evidence of hostile witnesses is not to completely discard the evidence given by them. This Court has held that even the evidence given by hostile witness may contain elements of truth. This Court has held in State of U.P. vs. Chetram and others, AIR 1989 SC 1543, that merely because the witnesses have been declared hostile the entire evidence should not be brushed aside. [See para 13 at page 1548]. Similar view has been expressed by three-judge Bench of this Court in Khujji alias Surendra Tiwari vs. State of Madhya 10 Pradesh , [AIR 1991 SC 1853]. At para 6, page 1857 of the report this Court speaking through Justice Ahmadi, as His Lordship then was, after referring to various judgments of this Court laid down that just because the witness turned hostile his entire evidence should not be washed out. Apart from that, the learned counsel submitted that the statement of the appellant under Section 313 was accompanied by written document. There the appellant had taken a defence plea that he wanted to save the deceased and in the process got his right hand burnt. However, neither the Trial Court nor the High Court had considered this aspect of the case. The learned counsel for the appellant has further submitted that the case of the prosecution as presented is totally improbable. He had strenuously urged that it was impossible for one individual to hold in one hand, a woman, who was struggling desparately to free herself from his grasp and to pour by the other hand three litres kerosene on her from a can with a small opening and then lit the matchstick, which requires the involvement by both the hands. The courts should have considered this aspect of the matter which would show the inherent improbability in the prosecution case. It cannot be denied, as it has come on evidence, that as the deceased was wearing a polyster saree, the burn injuries were aggravated which could not have been so if she would have been wearing a cotton dress. The fact that she was wearing a polyster saree is not disputed by the prosecution. The learned counsel submitted that considering the aforesaid facts into consideration by this Court, the case cannot come under Section 302 IPC. The learned counsel appearing for the State submitted 11 that the case of the appellant was twice considered by the Trial Court and also by the High Court and both the courts have found concurrently against him and overruled the aforesaid contentions. Learned counsel further submitted that the case falls squarely under Section 300 , thirdly of IPC . We have considered the relevant submission. We are of the view that in a case relating to circumstantial evidence, the Court should see the circumstances very carefully before arriving at a finding of guilt of the person concerned and yet if there is any doubt which is inconsistent with the innocence of the accused, the benefit should go to the accused. In the instant case, it is clear that the appellant had no pre-meditation to kill the deceased or cause any bodily harm or injury to the deceased. Everything has happened on the spur of the moment. The appellant must have lost self-control on some provocative utterances of the deceased. These possibilities cannot be ruled out, having regard to the evidence of PW.1. However, the fact that kerosene was sprinkled on the deceased by the appellant possibly cannot be disputed, in view of concurrent finding by both the courts and having regard to the materials on record. But whether the case falls under Section 300 , thirdly of IPC , is very doubtful. Having regard to the facts and circumstances of the case and in the light of defence of the deceased, this Court holds that the case falls under Section 304 Part II and the appellant has already suffered imprisonment for 11 years 2 months. In that view of the matter, this Court holds that the sentence which has already been undergone by the appellant is more than sufficient under Section 304 Part II. 12 However, the sentence of fine is set aside. Having regard to our finding, that the case falls under Section 304 Part II, the appeal is allowed to the extent indicated above. The appellant should be released forthwith, if not required in any other case. ...................J. (ASOK KUMAR GANGULY) ...................J. (DEEPAK VERMA) NEW DELHI MAY 19, 2011. 13"

Panchal REPORTABLE IN THE SUPREME COURT OF INDIA CIVIL APPELLATE JURISDICTION CIVIL APPEAL NO. 562 OF 2003 RANGAMMAL .. Appellant Versus KUPPUSWAMI & ANR. ..Respondents J U D G M E N T GYAN SUDHA MISRA, J. This appeal by special leave has been filed by the appellant Tmt. Rangammal against the order dated 11.07.2002 passed by the learned single Judge of the High Court of Judicature at Madras in Second Appeal No. 703/1992 by which the appeal was dismissed by practically a summary order although the substantial question of law which was formulated at the time of admission of the appeal was as follows: ""Whether the sale deed executed by the de facto guardian on behalf of the minor without the permission of the court could be held to be valid ? 2. However, on hearing the appeal in the light of the prevailing facts and circumstances of the instant matter, we are of the view that the question also arises whether in a partition suit filed by the plaintiff/respondent No.1 herein, the courts below could shift the burden of proof on the defendant - appellant regarding the validity of a sale deed, which was executed when the appellant was admittedly a minor, contrary to the pleading in the plaint filed in a suit for partition, who claimed title to the suit land on the basis of the alleged sale deed. Still further the question arises whether the question of limitation could arise against the defendant/appellant shifting the burden on her to challenge the sale deed, when the story of execution of the alleged sale deed was set up by the plaintiff/respondent No.1 in the plaint for the first time when he filed partition suit against his brother, without impleading the appellant, but claimed benefit of title to the suit land on the basis of the alleged sale deed. 3. In order to decide the aforesaid controversy, it is necessary to relate the facts giving rise to this appeal in so far as it is relevant which disclose that the appellant Tmt. Rangammal was impleaded as second defendant in a suit for partition bearing O.S. No. 255/1982 which had been filed by one Kuppuswami plaintiff-respondent No.1 herein in the court of District Munsif, Palani, against his brother Andivelu who was the principal defendant/1st defendant/respondent No.2 herein for partition and separate possession, but the plaintiff also included the property of the appellant-Rangammal in the schedule to the plaint without including her as a party to the suit as it was pleaded by the plaintiff-respondent No.1-Kuppuswami that the share which originally belonged to the appellant- Rangammal, was transferred to their predecessors, who were father and uncle of the plaintiff and defendant No.1/Respondent No.1 Andivelu, by way of a sale deed dated 24.2.1951 executed in their favour by Kumara Naicker who claimed to be the legal guardian of the Rangammal when the appellant/Rangammal was admittedly a minor and was barely few years old, less than even three years. The sale deed was claimed to have been 4 executed for legal necessity in order to discharge the debt of the deceased mother of the appellant in the year 1951 which according to the case of the plaintiff-respondent No. 1 had been transferred to their branch by virtue of the aforesaid sale deed executed on 24.2.1951 by the alleged guardian of the appellant Kumara Naicker. 4. Since the appellant had not been impleaded in the suit for partition although her property was included in the partition suit between the two brothers i.e. plaintiff Kuppuswami-respondent No.1 herein and Andivelu 1st defendant -respondent No.2 herein, the appellant filed an application for impleadment in the partition suit before the trial court which was allowed. 5. The appellant herein who was impleaded as a second defendant in the suit clearly pleaded that the partition suit filed by Kuppuswami-plaintiff against his brother Andivelu 1st defendant -respondent No.2 herein, was collusive in nature as this was clearly to deprive the 5 appellant from her share by relying on an alleged sale deed dated 24.2.1951 by fraudulently stating that the deceased mother of the appellant was owing certain debt during her lifetime and in order to discharge the same, the so- called legal guardian of the appellant Kumara Naicker executed a sale deed in favour of the father and uncle of the plaintiff and defendant No.1 who are respondents herein. It was, therefore, submitted by the appellant/2nd defendant in the suit that the sale deed dated 24.2.1951 alleged to have been executed in order to discharge the debt of her deceased mother, when the appellant was a minor, ought not to be held legally binding on her and so as to include her property for partition in the partition suit which had been instituted by an altogether different branch of the family who had separated more than three generations ago. Hence she specifically pleaded that the partition suit including her property was clearly collusive in nature and therefore the suit was fit to be dismissed. 6 6. In order to appreciate whether the courts below were justified in depriving the appellant Tmt. Rangammal from her share, it appears necessary to relate some other salient facts of the case leading up to the filing of this appeal. The schedule-property comprising an area of 4 acres and 10 cents described in various survey numbers originally belonged to one Laksmi Naicker-the common ancestor of contesting parties who had two sons and an oral partition had taken place between them in regard to the properties of the joint family including the schedule- property. Thereafter, a sale deed dated 24.2.1951 in respect of the schedule-property was executed by Kumara Naicker -alleged legal guardian of appellant-Rangammal who was one of the sons of late Kumara Naicker and wife of the elder son of Laksmi Naicker-Thottammal a cousin of her son, who was descendent of Kumara Naicker. Kumara Naicker, i.e. the son of the elder son of Laksmi Naicker executed the sale deed on behalf of the appellant herein, who was the daughter of younger son of Laksmi Naicker and Andi Naicker was admittedly a minor, representing himself as her guardian since she had lost both her father 7 and her mother at the time of the execution of the sale deed. However, the appellant according to her case continued in possession of half of the schedule property according to the oral partition which had fallen into the share of her father since the only brother of the appellant/ Rangammal had died unmarried. Thus, the appellant continued to be in possession of half of the property without any knowledge about the alleged sale deed. 7. The appellant's case is that as she was a minor and had lost both her parents, she was living with her maternal uncle even at the time of the alleged sale. The appellant's case is that the suit was instituted between the plaintiff-respondent No.1 herein and 1st defendant- respondent No.2 herein under the pretext of partition but in fact the idea behind institution of the suit was to oust the appellant who continued to be in possession of half of the share of the property being the sole legal representative of the younger son of Laksmi Naicker who was Andi Naicker. As already stated, the appellant in fact was not even made a party in the partition suit initially but was 8 later impleaded as 2nd defendant after she filed an application for her impleadment. 8. However, the High Court while dealing with the second appeal arising out of the partition suit, cast the burden completely on the appellant/2nd defendant to prove that the property shown in the sale deed which fell into the share of the appellant, was not for the purpose of discharge of the liability of her deceased mother who according to her case was not owing any debt to anyone including Kumara Naicker. But the suit was finally decreed in favour of the plaintiff/respondent No.1 holding therein that the appellant's deceased mother was owing certain debts and for discharge of the same, the so-called legal guardian of the appellant who was Kumara Naicker executed a sale deed in favour of the plaintiff's father and defendant No.1's father in respect of the entire property of Rangammal and this was done ostensibly as the appellant's mother had to discharge certain debts which she was owing to the plaintiff's father during her lifetime. Thus, the District Munsif, Palani, decreed the suit in favour of the plaintiff/1st respondent herein Kuppuswami. While 9 doing so, the trial court recorded a finding that the sale deed dated 24.2.1951 by which half share of the appellant in the suit property was transferred when the appellant was a minor had been executed by legal guardian Kumara Naicker for legal necessity according to the case of the appellant herein, Kumara Naicker the so-called legal guardian was neither her natural guardian nor guardian appointed by the court and hence the sale deed executed by him to the extent of half share of the schedule property of appellant-Rangammal was clearly void, illegal, inoperative and hence not binding on her. The trial court decreed the suit against which the appeal before the 1st appellate court was dismissed. The matter then came up to the High Court by way of a second appeal. 9. Learned counsel for the appellant while challenging the judgment and orders of the courts below submitted that the sale deed executed by the so-called de facto guardian Kumara Naicker and Thottammal cannot be held to be binding on her as she was a minor in the custody of her maternal uncle and not Kumara Naicker - father of the respondent No.2 and hence the sale deed 10 executed by him on her behalf was not binding on her as the same was executed in order to deprive her of her half share in the disputed property which is situated on the eastern portion of the schedule property. 10. The learned single Judge of the High Court however was pleased to dismiss the second appeal holding therein that the present suit out of which the second appeal arose was filed in the year 1982 which was after 31 years of the execution of the sale deed dated 24.2.1951. The single Judge further observed that if the appellant Tmt. Rangammal was aggrieved of the sale deed executed by the de facto guardian, she ought to have challenged it within three years from the date of attaining majority. The High Court went on to hold that until the date of filing of the present suit by the 1st respondent and even thereafter, the appellant had not chosen to challenge the sale deed executed by the de facto guardian and she never asserted any title in respect of the suit property irrespective of the sale deed in order to establish that she was aggrieved of the sale deed and hence it was too late for the appellant to 11 raise such a plea in the High Court by way of a second appeal. 11. We have heard learned counsel for the parties at length and on a consideration of their submissions in the light of the judgments and orders of the courts below, specially the High Court, we are clearly of the view that the High Court as also the courts below have clearly misconstrued the entire case of the plaintiff as well as the respondents and tried it contrary to the pleadings. The High Court has recorded that ""the present suit which was filed in the year 1982, is after 31 years"" i.e. after 31 years of the execution of the sale deed dated 24.2.1951. But it can be instantly noticed that the High Court has fallen into a crystal clear error as it has patently and unambiguously missed that the suit had not been filed by the appellant Tmt. Rangammal as she was the 2nd defendant who was later impleaded in the suit but the partition suit had been filed by the plaintiff-Kuppuswami-respondent No.1 herein against his brother the 2nd respondent-Andivelu-1st defendant which was a suit for partition of the property but while doing so he included and asserted title to the 12 property in the schedule of the plaint which admittedly had fallen into the share of the appellant's deceased-father which devolved upon her after the death of her father, mother and brother who died unmarried. But it is the plaintiff/respondent No.1 who came up with a case in the plaint that this property was transferred for legal necessity by the so-called legal guardian of the appellant by executing a sale deed on 24.2.1951 in favour of the respondents predecessors who were father and uncle of the plaintiff and 1st defendants/respondents herein. 12. The learned single Judge of the High Court as also the trial court and the lower appellate court thus have lost sight of the fact that it is the plaintiff/respondent No.1 herein who had come up with a case that the half share of the disputed property which on partition had fallen into the share of the appellant's father was sold out by Kumara Naicker as guardian of the appellant-who was a minor in order to discharge some debt which the appellant's deceased mother was alleged to be owing. However the disputed property which was sold in order to discharge the alleged burden of debt vide sale deed dated 24.2.1951 was 13 purchased by the plaintiff-1st respondent's father Arumuga Gounder and their uncle Kumara Naicker which means that the legal guardian Kumara Naicker claims the property of the appellant who was minor and then sold it to himself and nephew Arumuga Gounder. Furthermore, it is also the plaintiff's case that the property which had fallen into the share of Tmt. Rangammal had been sold out by Kumara Naicker to the father of Kuppuswami-Arumuga Gounder and Andivelu who was his own son. 13. Therefore, it is more than apparent that when the plaintiff/respondent came up with a case of execution of sale deed on 24.2.21951 for half of the schedule property/disputed property alleged to have been sold out for legal necessity which had fallen into the share of appellant Rangammal, the burden clearly lay on the plaintiff/respondent No.1 to discharge that the sale deed executed by Kumara Naicker to his own son and nephew Arumuga Gounder in regard to the share which had admittedly fallen into the appellant share Rangammal who was a minor, was sold for the legal necessity. But this burden by the trial court was wrongly cast upon the 14 appellant/Rangammal to discharge, although, it is well- settled that the party who pleads has also to prove his case. 14. Section 101 of the Indian Evidence Act, 1872 defines `burden of proof' which clearly lays down that whosoever desires any court to give judgment as to any legal right or law dependent on the existence of facts which he asserts, must prove that those facts exist. When a person is bound to prove the existence of any fact it is said that the burden of proof lies on that person. Thus, the Evidence Act has clearly laid down that the burden of proving fact always lies upon the person who asserts. Until such burden is discharged, the other party is not required to be called upon to prove his case. The court has to examine as to whether the person upon whom burden lies has been able to discharge his burden. Until he arrives at such conclusion, he cannot proceed on the basis of weakness of the other party. In view of this legal position of the Evidence Act , it is clear that in the instant matter, when the plaintiff/respondent No.1 pleaded that the disputed property fell into the share of the plaintiff by 15 virtue of the sale deed dated 24.2.1951, then it was clearly for the plaintiff/respondent No.1 to prove that it was executed for legal necessity of the appellant-while she was a minor. But, the High Court clearly took an erroneous view while holding that it is the defendant/appellant who should have challenged the sale deed after attaining majority as she had no reason to do so since the plaintiff /respondent No.1 failed to first of all discharge the burden that the sale deed in fact had been executed for legal necessity of the minor's predecessor mother was without permission of the court. It was not the defendant/respondent who first of all claimed benefit of the sale deed or asserted its genuineness, hence the burden of challenging the sale deed specifically when she had not even been dispossessed from the disputed share, did not arise at all. 15. Plethora of commentaries emerging from series of case laws on burden of proof which are too numerous to cite, lay down that when a person after attaining majority, questions any sale of his property by his guardian during his minority, the burden lies on the person who 16 upholds/asserts the purchase not only to show that the guardian had the power to sell but further that the whole transaction was bona fide. This was held in the case of Roop Narain vs. Gangadhar , 9WR 297, as also in Anna Malay vs. Na U Ma, 17C 990. Thus when the plaintiff/respondent No.1 came up with a case that the minor's share/appellant herein was sold for legal necessity by her uncle Kumara Naicker, then it was the plaintiff/respondent No.1 who should have discharged the burden to prove that the minor/appellant's share had been sold of by the de facto guardian Kumara Naicker without permission of the court, could be held to be legal and valid so as to include the same in the partition suit between two brothers, which has not been discharged at all by the plaintiff/respondent No.1. In fact, the real brother of plaintiff Kuppuswami who is defendant No.1/respondent No.1 herein Andivelu has also not supported the case of the plaintiff that the half share of appellant/Rangammal in the disputed property was sold out vide sale deed dated 24.2.1951 for legal necessity without permission of the Court and hence defendant No.1/respondent No.2 also has 17 not supported the case of the plaintiff/respondent No.1 on this count. 16. The plaintiff/respondent No.1 therefore has miserably failed to prove his case as per his pleading in the plaint and the burden to prove that the sale deed in fact was valid has not even been cast on plaintiff/respondent No.1 that the share of appellant-Rangammal had been sold out by Kumara Naicker vide sale deed dated 24.2.1951 for consideration without permission of the Court when the appellant was a minor. 17. The High Court, therefore, has fallen into an error while observing that the appellant/defendant No.2 in the suit should have assailed the sale deed and cannot do so after 31 years of its execution when it is unambiguously an admitted factual position that it is the plaintiff/respondent No.1 who had filed a suit for partition against his brother defendant No.1/respondent No.2 and in that partition suit it was plaintiff/respondent No.1 who banked upon the story that a sale deed had been executed by his Uncle Kumara Naicker who claimed it to be the legal guardian of the appellant-Rangammal who admittedly was a 18 minor for legal necessity which was to discharge the debt of the appellant's deceased mother. Hence, in view of Section 101 of the Indian Evidence Act, 1872 it is the plaintiff/respondent No.1 who should have first of all discharged the burden that in fact a sale deed had been executed for the share which admittedly belonged to appellant-Rangammal in order to discharge the burden of debt for legal necessity and for the benefit of the appellant who admittedly was a minor. 18. When the plaintiff-respondent No.1-Kuppuswami came with a specific pleading for the first time in a partition suit that the appellant's share had been sold out by her de facto guardian Kumara Naicker without even the permission of the court, it was clearly the plaintiff/respondent No.1 who should have discharged the burden that the same was done for legal necessity of the minor in order to discharge the debt which the deceased mother of the appellant was alleged to have been owing to some one. When the plaintiff/respondent No.1 failed to discharge this burden, the question of discharge of burden to disprove the sale deed by the 2nd defendant/appellant-Rangammal do not 19 arise at all as per the provisions of Evidence Act . It may be relevant at this stage to cite the ratio of the decision of this Court delivered in the matter of Subhra Mukherjee vs. Bharat Coaking Coal Ltd , AIR 2000 SC 1203, whether the document in question was genuine or sham or bogus, the party who alleged it to be bogus had to prove nothing until the party relying upon the document established its genuineness. This was the view expressed by this Court in the matter of Subhra Mukherjee vs. Bharat Coaking Coal Ltd , AIR 2000 SC 1203 = 2000 (3) SCC 312. This case although did not relate to a suit for partition or question relating to minority, it was a case wherein the appellant refused to hand over possession of property to the respondent-government company when ordered to do so. Instead she filed a suit for declaration of title in respect of property. The evidence of plaintiff/appellant indicated several discrepancies and inconsistencies due to which the trial court dismissed the suit but the 1st appellate court and the High Court, had allowed the appeal which was upheld by the Supreme Court as it was held that the High Court rightly allowed the respondent's/government 20 company's second appeal and rightly found that the sale in favour of the appellant was not bona fide and thus confer no rights on them. 19. Application of Section 101 of the Evidence Act, 1872 thus came up for discussion in this matter and while discussing the law on the burden of proof in the context of dealing with the allegation of sham and bogus transaction, it was held that party which makes allegation must prove it. But the court was further pleased to hold wherein the question before the court was ""whether the transaction in question was a bona fide and genuine one"" so that the party/plaintiff relying on the transaction had to first of all prove its genuineness and only thereafter would the defendant be required to discharge the burden in order to dislodge such proof and establish that the transaction was sham and fictitious. This ratio can aptly be relied upon in this matter as in this particular case, it is the plaintiff/respondent No.1-Kuppuswami who relied upon the alleged sale deed dated 24.2.1951 and included the subject-matter of the property which formed part of the sale deed and claimed partition. This sale deed was denied by 21 the defendant/appellant on the ground that it was bogus and a sham transaction which was executed admittedly in 1951 when she was a minor. Thus, it was the plaintiff/respondent No.1 who should have first of all discharged the burden that the sale deed executed during the minority of the appellant was genuine and was fit to be relied upon. If the courts below including the High Court had felt satisfied on this aspect, only then the burden could be shifted on the defendant/appellant to dislodge the case of the plaintiff that the sale deed was not genuine. But when the plaintiff merely pleaded in the plaint but failed to lead any evidence - much less proof, that the sale deed was genuine and was executed in order to discharge the burden of legal necessity in the interest of minor, then the High Court clearly misdirected itself by recording in the impugned order that it is the defendant/appellant herein who should have challenged the genuineness of the sale deed after attaining majority within the period of limitation. 20. Since the High Court has misplaced burden of proof, it clearly vitiated its own judgments as also of the 22 courts below since it is well established dictum of the Evidence Act that misplacing burden of proof would vitiate judgment. It is also equally and undoubtedly true that the burden of proof may not be of much consequence after both the parties lay evidence, but while appreciating the question of burden of proof, misplacing of burden of proof on a particular party and recording findings in a particular way definitely vitiates the judgment as it has happened in the instant matter. This position stands reinforced by several authorities including the one delivered in the case of Koppula Koteshwara Rao vs. Koppula Hemant Rao, 2002 AIHC 4950 (AP). 21. It has been further held by the Supreme Court in the case of State of J & K vs. Hindustan Forest Company, 2006 (12) SCC 198, wherein it was held that the onus is on the plaintiff to positively establish its case on the basis of material available and it cannot rely on the weakness or absence of defence to discharge onus. 22. It was still further held by this Court in the matter of Corporation of City of Bangalore vs. Zulekha Bi , 2008 (11) SCC 306 (308) that it is for the plaintiff to prove 23 his title to the property. This ratio can clearly be made applicable to the facts of this case for it is the plaintiff who claimed title to the property which was a subject-matter of the alleged sale deed of 24.2.1951 for which he had sought partition against his brother and, therefore, it was clearly the plaintiff who should have first of all established his case establishing title of the property to the joint family out of which he was claiming his share. When the plaintiff himself failed to discharge the burden to prove that the sale deed which he executed in favour of his own son and nephew by selling the property of a minor of whom he claimed to be legal guardian without permission of the court, it was clearly fit to be set aside by the High Court which the High Court as also the courts below have miserably failed to discharge. The onus was clearly on the plaintiff to positively establish his case on the basis of material available and could not have been allowed by the High Court to rely on the weakness or absence of defence of the defendant/appellant herein to discharge such onus. 23. The courts below thus have illegally and erroneously failed not to cast this burden on the 24 plaintiff/respondent No.1 by clearly misconstruing the whole case and thus resulted into recording of findings which are wholly perverse and even against the admitted case of the parties. 24. It is further well-settled that a suit has to be tried on the basis of the pleadings of the contesting parties which is filed in the suit before the trial court in the form of plaint and written statement and the nucleus of the case of the plaintiff and the contesting case of the defendant in the form of issues emerges out of that. This basic principle, seems to have been missed not only by the trial court in this case but consistently by the first appellate court which has been compounded by the High Court. 25. Thus, we are of the view, that the whole case out of which this appeal arises had been practically made a mess by missing the basic principle that the suit should be decided on the basis of the pleading of the contesting parties after which Section 101 of The Evidence Act would come into play in order to determine on whom the burden falls for proving the issues which have been determined. 25 26. We further fail to comprehend as to how the basic case pleaded by the plaintiff had been misconstrued and the burden of discharge of genuineness, veracity and legal efficacy of the sale deed dated 24.2.1951 was shifted on the appellant-Rangammal clearly missing that it is the plaintiff's/respondent No.1 case who was bent upon to include Rangammal's property also for partition by relying upon the story of execution of sale deed when the partition suit was between the two brothers who were plaintiff- Kuppuswami and defendant No.1-Andivelu. 27. Coming now to the next question, we are unable to appreciate as to how the High Court has held that the delay in challenging the sale deed of 1951 should have been done at the instance of the 2nd defendant-appellant herein when it is the plaintiff who brought the theory/story of execution of the sale deed of appellant Rangammal's property into the branch of plaintiff/respondents' branch by pleading and asserting that this had fallen into the share of their predecessor as one of the predecessors was the de facto guardian of the appellant Rangammal. In fact, if there was a dispute about 26 the genuineness and veracity of the sale deed and the appellant was in occupation of her share, then it is the plaintiff who should have filed a suit claiming title on the basis of the sale deed which was claimed to have been executed in their favour by the de facto guardian of Rangammal when she was a minor before this property could be included in the suit for partition between the brothers excluding the 2nd defendant/appellant Rangammal and the consequence of not doing so or delay in this regard, obviously will have to be attributed to the plaintiff/respondent. 28. Thus, the High Court fell into a clear error when it observed that the suit was barred by limitation as it had been filed after 31 years of the execution of the sale deed which on the face of it is factually incorrect. The High Court has clearly erred while recording so, as it seems to have missed that the suit had not been filed by the appellant herein but she was merely contesting the suit as the 2nd defendant by getting herself impleaded in the partition suit when it came to her knowledge that the property which is in her occupation and possession has 27 also been included in the schedule in the suit for partition between plaintiff/respondent No.1 herein-Kuppuswamy and the 1st defendant/respondent No.2 herein-Andivelu and when she received the copy of the plaint, execution of the alleged sale deed way back in 1951 was disclosed to her for the first time. Hence, there was no cause of action for her to file a suit challenging the alleged sale deed as knowledge of the same cannot be attributed to her in this regard as she asserted actual physical possession on her share. 29. The appellant who claimed to be in occupation and peaceful possession of her share to the extent of half which is situated on the eastern side of the schedule property, had no reason to file a suit assailing the sale deed when she was in actual physical possession of her share and suddenly out of the blue, a partition suit was filed by the plaintiff/respondent No.1 wherein the property of the appellant also was included in the schedule of the partition suit which was to be partitioned between the two brothers by metes and bounds by setting a cooked up story that the appellant's share, who belonged to an altogether 28 different branch of the family, had been given away by her de facto guardian Kumara Naicker by executing a sale deed in favour of the respondents' predecessor way back on 24.2.1951 when the appellant admittedly was a minor. 30. We are, therefore, constrained to partly set aside the judgment and order of the High Court in so far as the share of the appellant Rangammal is concerned and consequently the decree passed by the trial court, upheld by the first appellate court and the High Court which had been illegally decreed including the share of the appellant -Rangammal which had not devolved on the family of the plaintiff/respondent No.1 and defendant No.1/respondent No.2, but was claimed on the basis of a sale deed which could not be proved either by evidence or law, is fit to be set aside. 31. It hardly needs to be highlighted that in a suit for partition, it is expected of the plaintiff to include only those properties for partition to which the family has clear title and unambiguously belong to the members of the joint family which is sought to be partitioned and if someone else's property meaning thereby disputed property is 29 included in the schedule of the suit for partition, and the same is contested by a third party who is allowed to be impleaded by order of the trial court, obviously it is the plaintiff who will have to first of all discharge the burden of proof for establishing that the disputed property belongs to the joint family which should be partitioned excluding someone who claims that some portion of the joint family property did not belong to the plaintiff's joint family in regard to which decree for partition is sought. 32. However, we make it clear that the decree which has been passed by the trial court in so far as partition between plaintiff/respondent No.1 and defendant No.1/respondent No.2 is concerned, shall remain in tact but the said decree shall exclude the property which had fallen into the share of appellant-Rangammal but was claimed to have been transferred to the branch of the plaintiff and 1st defendant-respondents herein vide sale deed dated 24.2.1951 The trial court being the court of District Munsif, Palani, accordingly shall modify the decree passed in O.S. No.255 of 1982 by excluding the share of the appellant -Rangammal claimed on the basis of the sale 30 deed dated 24.2.1951. Thereafter, if the decree is put to execution, the executing court shall ensure that such portion of the property which is in occupation of Rangammal which was alleged to have been sold vide sale deed dated 24.2.1951, shall not be put into execution while partitioning the remaining property between the plaintiff- Kuppuswami and 1st defendant -Andivelu - respondent No.2. 33. Thus, this appeal in so far as the claim of the appellant- Rangammal to the extent of half of the share in the schedule to the suit property, situated on the eastern portion is concerned, stands allowed with a token cost which is quantified at rupees twenty five thousand as we are of the view that the appellant who was in actual physical and peaceful possession of her property which she had inherited from her deceased parents, was unnecessarily dragged into this litigation at the instance of the plaintiff- Kuppuswami who filed a partition suit which was apparently collusive in nature as it included the share of a third party to which the plaintiff and 1st defendant's family had no clear title. Under the facts and circumstance of 31 the instant case, it was clearly a compulsion on the part of the appellant/Tmt. Rangammal to contest the collusive suit for decades Kwasting time, energy and expense over a litigation which was started by the plaintiff clearly with an oblique motive and evil design. Hence the cost shall be paid by the respondent No.1-Kuppuswami to the appellant- Rangammal as indicated above. 34. Accordingly, this appeal stands allowed with costs. ..................................J (J.M. Panchal) ..................................J (Gyan Sudha Misra ) New Delhi, May 13, 2011 32"

Singhvi, J. 1. Leave granted. 2. The only question which needs consideration in these appeals is whether the appellants who had not been granted recognition by the Western Regional Committee of the National Council for Teacher Education and who 2 did not get affiliation from the examining body in accordance with the provisions of the National Council for Teacher Education Act, 1993 (for short, `the Act') and the National Council for Teacher Education (Recognition, Norms and Procedure) Regulations, 2007 (for short, `the Regulations') are entitled to question the order passed by the Division Bench of the Bombay High Court, Nagpur Bench whereby recognition granted to over 290 institutions was cancelled. 3. With a view to achieve the object of planned and coordinated development for the teacher education system throughout the country and for regulation and proper maintenance of norms and standards in the teacher education system and for matters connected therewith, Parliament enacted the Act for the establishment of a Council to be called the National Council for Teacher Education (for short, ""the NCTE"") with multifarious functions, powers and duties. Section 2(c) of the Act defines the term ""Council"" to mean a Council established under sub-section (1) of Section 3 . Section 2(i) defines the term ""recognised institution"" to mean an institution recognised under Section 14 . Section 2(j) defines the term ""Regional Committee"" to mean a Committee established under Section 20 . Section 3 provides for establishment of the Council which comprises of a Chairperson, a Vice- Chairperson, a Member-Secretary, various functionaries of the Government, thirteen persons possessing experience and knowledge in the field of 3 education or teaching, nine members representing the States and Union Territories Administration, three members of Parliament, three members to be appointed from amongst teachers of primary and secondary education and teachers of recognised institutions. Section 12 of the Act enumerates functions of the Council. Section 14 provides for recognition of institutions offering course or training in teacher education. Section 15 lays down the procedure for obtaining permission by an existing institution for starting a new course or training. Section 16 contains a non obstante clause and lays down that an examining body shall not grant affiliation to any institution or hold examination for a course or training conducted by a recognised institution unless it has obtained recognition from the concerned Regional Committee under Section 14 or permission for starting a new course or training under Section 15 . The mechanism for dealing with the cases involving violation of the provisions of the Act or the rules, regulations, orders made or issued thereunder or the conditions of recognition by a recognised institution finds place in Section 17 . By an amendment made in July, 2006, Section 17-A was added to the Act. It lays down that no institution shall admit any student to a course or training in teacher education unless it has obtained recognition under Section 14 or permission under Section 15 . Section 29 declares that the NCTE shall, in the discharge of its functions and duties under the Act be bound by such directions on questions of policy as the Central Government may give in writing from 4 time to time and the decision of the Central Government as to whether a question is one of policy or not shall be final. Section 31(1) empowers the Central Government to make rules for carrying out the provisions of the Act. Section 31(2) specifies the matters in respect of which the Central Government can make rules. Under Section 32(1) the Council can make regulations for implementation of the provisions of the Act subject to the rider that the regulations shall not be inconsistent with the provisions of the Act and the rules made thereunder. Section 32(2) specifies the matters on which the Council can frame regulations. Sections 12 , 14 to 16 and 17-A of the Act, which have bearing on the decision of these appeals read as under: ""12.

(13) to (16) xxx xxx xxx"" 5. Vide letter dated 2.2.1996, the NCTE issued guidelines for ensuring that the training institutions are established keeping in view the requirement of trained teachers in different States and U.T. These guidelines read as under: 1 ""1. The establishment of teacher training institutions by the Government, private managements or any other agencies should largely be determined by assessed need for trained teachers. This need should take into consideration the supply of trained teachers from existing institutions, the requirement of such teachers in relation to enrolment projections at various stages, the attrition rates among trained teachers due to superannuation, change of occupation, death, etc. and the number of trained teachers on the live register of the employment exchanges seeking employment and the possibility of their deployment. The States having more than the required number of trained teachers may not encourage opening of new institutions for teacher education or to increase the intake. 2. The States having shortage of trained teachers may encourage establishment of new institutions for teacher education and to increase intake capacity for various levels of teacher education institutions keeping in view the requirements of teachers estimated for the next 10-15 years. 3. Preference might be given to institutions which tend to emphasise the preparation of teachers for subjects (such as Science, Mathematics, English, etc.) for which trained teachers have been in short supply in relation to requirement of schools. 4. Apart from the usual courses for teacher preparation, institutions which propose to concern themselves with new emerging specialities (e.g. computer education, use of electronic media, guidance and counselling, etc.) should receive priority. Provisions for these should, however, be made only after ensuring that requisite manpower, equipment and infrastructure are available. These considerations will also be kept in view by the institution intending to provide for optional subjects to be chosen by students such as guidance and counselling, special education, etc. 5. With a view to ensuring supply of qualified and trained teachers for such specialities such as education of the 1 disabled, non-formal education, education of adults, pre- school education, vocational education, etc. special efforts and incentives may be provided to motivate private managements/voluntary organisations for establishment of institutions, which lay emphasis on these areas. 6. With a view to promoting professional commitment among prospective teachers, institutions which can ensure adequate residential facilities for the Principal and staff of the institutions as well as hostel facilities for substantial proportion of its enrolment should be encouraged. 7. Considering that certain areas (tribal, hilly regions, etc.) have found it difficult to attain qualified and trained teachers, it would be desirable to encourage establishment of training institutions in those areas. 8. Institutions should be allowed to come into existence only if the sponsors are able to ensure that they have adequate material and manpower resources in terms, for instance, of qualified teachers and other staff, adequate buildings and other infrastructure (laboratory, library, etc.), a reserve fund and operating funds to meet the day-to-day requirements of the institutions, including payment of salaries, provision of equipment, etc. Laboratories, teaching science methodologies and practicals should have adequate gas plants, proper fittings and regular supply of water, electricity, etc. They should also have adequate arrangements. Capabilities of the institution for fulfilling norms prepared by NCTE may be kept in view. 9. In the establishment of an institution preference needs to be given to locations which have a large catchment area in terms of schools of different levels where student teachers can be exposed to demonstration lessons and undertake practice teaching. A training institution which has a demonstration school where innovative and experimental approaches can be demonstrated could be given preference."" 1 6. For facilitating grant of recognition for establishment of teacher training institutions in different parts of the country, four Regional Committees including the Western Regional Committee at Bhopal (for short, `WRC, Bhopal') were set up by the NCTE. In 2006-2007, WRC, Bhopal granted recognition/permission to large number of colleges/institutions to start B.Ed./D.Ed. courses in the four States falling within its jurisdiction, i.e. Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra and Goa. On receipt of complaints that grave irregularities were committed by WRC, Bhopal in granting recognition/permission, the Central Government (Ministry of Human Resource Development) in exercise of the power vested in it under Section 29 of the Act issued order dated 21.8.2007 and directed WRC, Bhopal not to grant recognition to any institution/course till a comprehensive review was undertaken. On 23.8.2007, the Central Government constituted three member Committee headed by Ms. Anita Kaul, Joint Secretary, Ministry of Human Resource Development to conduct an in-depth inquiry into the working of WRC, Bhopal. In its report, the Committee highlighted the irregularities committed by WRC, Bhopal in granting recognition to various institutions in the States of Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh and Gujarat without taking into consideration the views of the concerned State Governments. After considering the report of the Committee, the Central Government issued the following directions to the NCTE: 1 ""(a) The WRC, Bhopal will process all pending applications ensuring, however, that it scrupulously takes into account the views of the State Government on the issue of sanction or rejection of applications for recognition. In case, WRC, Bhopal differs with the views of the State Government, it shall record specific reasons in writing in such case and submit a special report to NCTE headquarters; (b) NCTE shall expedite the study on the demand and supply of teachers/teaching capacity specially for the State of Maharashtra, Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh and; (c) The recommendations in respect of amendments to NCTE Act and its Regulations shall be carefully examined in consultation with Ministry of Law."" 7. The aforesaid directions were considered in the 100th meeting of WRC, Bhopal and the following norms were laid down for considering the recommendations of the State Government: ""(a) If there is any positive recommendation from the State Government, recognition/permission will be granted as per the NCTE Regulations: (b) If the Government has not communicated any positive or negative remarks within 60 days from the issuance of the letter from the WRC to the concerned Government, cases will be considered on merit basis: (c) In case of the negative recommendation without any justification, cases will be considered on merit basis; (d) If the State Government's negative recommendations are there in respect of a particular institution with justification and in the opinion of the Committee the justification is genuine, the cases will be rejected. The intimation of such cases will be sent to the NCTE headquarters. 1 (e) If the WRC differs with the negative reasons/opinion of the State Government, cases will be forwarded to the NCTE headquarters."" 8. The appellant institutions submitted applications in 2006 and 2007 for grant of recognition for starting D.Ed course. The establishments of the appellants were inspected in March, May, June and July 2008. After considering the inspection reports, WRC, Bhopal issued letters to the appellants requiring them to give clarification on some issues. The matter was again considered in the meetings of WRC, Bhopal held in September/October 2008 in the light of the directives issued by the Central Government and the appellants were informed that their cases will not be processed. This was done in the back-drop of the recommendations made by the State Government that there was no requirement of trained teachers in the State. In the cases of Rajarshi Sahoo Chatrapati Education Society, Jagruti Shikshan Sanstha and Navyuvak Shikshan Mandal, letters of intent were issued, but final recognition was not granted under Section 14 of the Act read with Regulation 8(12) of 2007 Regulations. The appeal filed by Navyuvak Sikshan Mandal under Section 18 of the Act was dismissed by the appellate Authority. 9. In the meanwhile, respondent Nos.6 and 7 filed writ petition questioning the exercise undertaken by WRC, Bhopal for grant of 1 recognition to over 290 institutions. They alleged that recognition has been granted in total disregard of the provisions of the Act and the Regulations and that the views of the State Government were completely ignored. The Division Bench of the High Court, after an in-depth examination of the record produced before it and the relevant statutory provisions, quashed the recognitions granted by WRC, Bhopal. 10. Although, the appellants were not at all affected by the order of the Division Bench of the High Court because they had not been granted recognition by WRC, Bhopal, they filed special leave petitions and prayed for setting aside orders dated 7.1.2009 and 16.1.2009 passed by the Division Bench of the High Court. They also filed applications for permission to file special leave petitions by stating that the orders passed by the High Court would adversely affect their right to continue the D.Ed. course. The appellants pleaded that the High Court could not have quashed the recognition granted by WRC, Bhopal without hearing the affected persons and without examining the issue of locus standi of the writ petitioners. They also claimed that infrastructure has been created by investing huge amount and cancellation of recognition will cause irreparable loss to them. In the synopsis and list of dates, all the appellants made categorical statement that after following the procedure prescribed under the Act and the Regulations, the NCTE granted permission/recognition to them for starting D.Ed. course. 1 11. Since the Court was not apprised of the true status of the applications filed by the appellants for grant of recognition and patently wrong and misleading statements were made that they have been duly recognised by the NCTE, this Court entertained the special leave petitions along with large number of other similar cases filed by those who had been granted recognition by WRC, Bhopal, issued notices and passed order of status quo. Later on, further interim orders were passed directing the State Government to allot students to the appellants for D. Ed course. 12. In the case of Abhyudya Sanstha, some interesting developments took place during the pendency of the special leave petition. By an order dated 26.4.2009/3.5.2010, WRC, Bhopal refused recognition to the appellant. The Writ Petition filed by the institute was allowed by the Division Bench of the High Court and WRC, Bhopal was directed to reconsider the appellant's plea for recognition. After remand, WRC, Bhopal reconsidered the appellant's application and rejected the same vide order dated 3.5.2010. The appeal preferred against that order was dismissed by the competent authority. This time, the appellant did not approach the Bombay High Court. Instead, it filed Writ Petition No. 6784 of 2010 in the Delhi High Court. By an order dated 17.1.2011, the learned Single Judge allowed the writ petition and remitted the matter to WRC, Bhopal for processing the applications of the appellant afresh. These additional facts 2 clearly demonstrate that on the date of filing the special leave petition, appellant Abhyudya Sanstha did not have recognition in terms of Section 14 read with Regulation 7(11) . The position of the other appellants is no better. Three of them got letters of intent but none was granted recognition. We have no doubt that if the appellants had not misrepresented the facts and made wrong statement on the issue of their recognition by WRC, Bhopal, this Court would not have entertained the special leave petition, what to say of passing interim orders. 13. At the hearing, Shri Shekhar Naphade and Shri Ashok Srivastava, learned senior counsel appearing for some of the appellants fairly stated that their clients were not granted recognition by WRC, Bhopal and none of them was eligible to admit the students to D. Ed. course, but submitted that the Court may direct WRC, Bhopal to reconsider their applications for recognition and protect the students who got admission on the basis of allotment made by the State Government so that they may not face difficulty in getting employment on the basis of the degrees etc. awarded by the affiliating body. Learned senior counsel submitted that the statements made in the synopsis and list of dates of the special leave petitions about grant of recognition by NCTE were not deliberate and the institutions and the students may not be penalized for the lapse, which inadvertently occurred at the time of drafting the petitions. Shri Ashok Srivastava, learned senior 2 counsel stated that his client has not admitted any student on the strength of the interim order passed by this Court. 14. Shri Amitesh Kumar, learned counsel for the NCTE submitted that the Court may not issue any direction for regularisation of admissions made by the appellants because none of them had been granted recognition by WRC, Bhopal. Learned counsel argued that in the absence of recognition by the competent authority, the appellants are not entitled to conduct any teacher training course and, therefore, the students admitted by them should not be allowed to reap the benefits of illegal admissions. 15. We have considered the respective submissions and carefully examined the records. 16. In our view, the appellants deserve to be non suited because they have not approached the Court with clean hands. The plea of inadvertent mistake put forward by the learned senior counsel for the appellants and their submission that the Court may take lenient view and order regularisation of the admissions already made sounds attractive but does not merit acceptance. Each of the appellants consciously made a statement that it had been granted recognition by the NCTE, which necessarily implies that recognition was granted in terms of Section 14 of the Act read with 2 Regulations 7 and 8 of the 2007 Regulations. Those managing the affairs of the appellants do not belong to the category of innocent, illiterate/uneducated persons, who are not conversant with the relevant statutory provisions and the court process. The very fact that each of the appellants had submitted application in terms of Regulation 7 and made itself available for inspection by the team constituted by WRC, Bhopal shows that they were fully aware of the fact that they can get recognition only after fulfilling the conditions specified in the Act and the Regulations and that WRC, Bhopal had not granted recognition to them. Notwithstanding this, they made bold statement that they had been granted recognition by the competent authority and thereby succeeded in persuading this Court to entertain the special leave petitions and pass interim orders. The minimum, which can be said about the appellants is that they have not approached the Court with clean hands and succeeded in polluting the stream of justice by making patently false statement. Therefore, they are not entitled to relief under Article 136 of the Constitution. This view finds support from plethora of precedents. In Hari Narain v. Badri Das AIR 1963 SC 1558, G. Narayanaswamy Reddy v. Govt. of Karnataka (1991) 3 SCC 261 and large number of other cases, this Court denied relief to the petitioner/appellant on the ground that he had not approached the Court with clean hands. In Hari Narain v. Badri Das (supra), the Court revoked the leave granted to the appellant and observed: 2 ""It is of utmost importance that in making material statements and setting forth grounds in applications for special leave made under Article 136 of the Constitution, care must be taken not to make any statements which are inaccurate, untrue or misleading. In dealing with applications for special leave, the Court naturally takes statements of fact and grounds of fact contained in the petitions at their face value and it would be unfair to betray the confidence of the Court by making statements which are untrue and misleading. Thus, if at the hearing of the appeal the Supreme Court is satisfied that the material statements made by the appellant in his application for special leave are inaccurate and misleading, and the respondent is entitled to contend that the appellant may have obtained special leave from the Supreme Court on the strength of what he characterises as misrepresentations of facts contained in the petition for special leave, the Supreme Court may come to the conclusion that in such a case special leave granted to the appellant ought to be revoked."" In G. Narayanaswamy Reddy v. Govt. of Karnataka (supra), the Court noted that the appellant had concealed the fact that the award could not be made by the Land Acquisition Officer within the time prescribed under Section 11A of the Land Acquisition Act because of the stay order passed by the High Court and observed: ""...... Curiously enough, there is no reference in the special leave petitions to any of the stay orders and we came to know about these orders only when the respondents appeared in response to the notice and filed their counter-affidavit. In our view, the said interim orders have a direct bearing on the question raised and the non-disclosure of the same certainly amounts to suppression of material facts. On this ground alone, the special leave petitions are liable to be rejected. It is well settled in law that the relief under Article 136 of the Constitution is discretionary and a petitioner who approaches this Court for such relief must come with frank and full disclosure of facts. If he fails to do so and suppresses material 2 facts, his application is liable to be dismissed. We accordingly dismiss the special leave petitions."" In Dalip Singh v. State of U.P. (2010) 2 SCC 114, this Court noticed the progressive decline in the values of life and observed: ""For many centuries Indian society cherished two basic values of life i.e. ""satya"" (truth) and ""ahimsa"" (non-violence). Mahavir, Gautam Buddha and Mahatma Gandhi guided the people to ingrain these values in their daily life. Truth constituted an integral part of the justice-delivery system which was in vogue in the pre-Independence era and the people used to feel proud to tell truth in the courts irrespective of the consequences. However, post-Independence period has seen drastic changes in our value system. The materialism has overshadowed the old ethos and the quest for personal gain has become so intense that those involved in litigation do not hesitate to take shelter of falsehood, misrepresentation and suppression of facts in the court proceedings. In the last 40 years, a new creed of litigants has cropped up. Those who belong to this creed do not have any respect for truth. They shamelessly resort to falsehood and unethical means for achieving their goals. In order to meet the challenge posed by this new creed of litigants, the courts have, from time to time, evolved new rules and it is now well established that a litigant, who attempts to pollute the stream of justice or who touches the pure fountain of justice with tainted hands, is not entitled to any relief, interim or final."" 17. The question which remains to be considered is whether the Court should direct regularisation of the admission of the students, who were allotted to the appellants by the State Government etc. pursuant to the directions given by this Court. Although, in the absence of cogent material, it is not possible to record a finding that the students were party to the patently wrong and misleading statement made by the appellants, the Court 2 cannot overlook the fact that none of the appellants has been granted recognition by WRC, Bhopal and in view of the prohibition contained in Section 17A of the Act read with Regulation 8(12) , the appellants could not have admitted any student. However, with a view to make business and earn profit in the name of education, the appellants successfully manipulated the judicial process for allocation of the students. Therefore, there is no valid ground much less justification to confer legitimacy upon the admission made by the appellants in a clandestine manner. Any such order by the Court will be detrimental to the national interest. The students who may have taken admission and completed the course from an institution, which had not been granted recognition, will not be able to impart value based education to the future generation of the country. Rather, they may train young minds as to how one can succeed in life by manipulations. Therefore, we do not consider it proper to issue direction for regularising the admissions made by the appellants on the strength of the interim orders passed by this Court. 18. In the result, the appeals are dismissed. Each of the appellants is saddled with costs of Rs.2 lacs, which shall be deposited with the Maharashtra State Legal Services Authority within a period of three months. If the needful is not done, the Secretary, Maharashtra State Legal Services Authority shall be entitled to recover the amount of cost as arrears of land revenue. 2 19. We also declare that none of the students, who had taken admission on the basis of allotment made by the State Government etc., shall be eligible for the award of degree etc. by the affiliating body. If the degree has already been awarded to any such student, the same shall not be treated valid for any purpose whatsoever. 20. WRC, Bhopal shall publish a list of the students, who were admitted by the appellants pursuant to the interim orders passed by this Court and forward the same to the Education Department of the Government of Maharashtra, which shall circulate the same to all government and aided institutions so that they may not employ the holders of such degrees. 21. The appellants are directed to pay Rs.1 lac to each of the students by way of compensation in lieu of the injury inflicted upon them by way of misrepresentation about their entitlement to admit the students to D.Ed. course. .............................................J.

(for short ""the Company"") for offences punishable under Sections 120B , 420 , 409 , 468 and 471 of the Indian Penal Code, 1860 (for short ""the IPC ""). 3.Briefly stated, the facts, material for adjudication of the issue, arising in this appeal, are as follows: A source information was received by the Central Bureau of Investigation (for short ""the CBI"") that in the year 1999 two Chartered Accountants, namely, Sanjay Malik and Bipin Kakkar, had dishonestly and fraudulently opened/caused to be opened several fictitious accounts in some banks in the names of certain concerns, with an intention and object to facilitate the diversion of bank finance availed by various public limited companies for the purpose other than what had been stated in the loan application. On the basis of the said information, a First Information Report (FIR) was registered against the afore-mentioned Company and its directors. The relevant portion of the FIR reads thus: ""That in June 1999, S/Sh. K.B. Suri, Sushil Suri and Smt. Kanta Suri, the Executive Directors of M/s. Morepen Labs Ltd. having their office at 416-418, Antriksh Bhawan (sic), 22, K.G. Marg, New Delhi, conspired together and in furtherance of the said criminal conspiracy they, dishonestly and fraudulently made an application to Punjab & Sind Bank, Connaught Place, New Delhi for Hire-Purchase Finance to the tune of `300 Lacs, by submitting fake and forged purchase orders, invoices and bills relating to supply of machineries and equipments to be installed in their factory/works situated in Distt. Solan (HP). That the above Executive Directors of the company, dishonestly, fraudulently and in conspiracy with other accused persons submitted to the bank, fake and forged invoices of fictitious/non-existent supplier i.e. M/s. R.K. Engineers, M/s. Teem Metals Pvt. Ltd. and M/s. Malson Impex, made accommodation payments representing as genuine advance payments to suppliers and thereby caused the bank to release funds to the tune of `300 lacs towards cost of machineries and 2 equipments and pay orders in various amounts issued by the bank for the purpose of making payments to suppliers. These amounts were then fraudulently deposited in several fictitious accounts of S/Sh. Sanjay Malik and Bipin Kakkar at Corporation Bank and Canara Bank and encashed. The bank finance raised by the company on the pretext of procurement of machineries and equipments were not used for the purpose stated in the application for loan, instead the bank loan was diverted by the above Executive Directors, in collusion with S/Sh. Sanjay Malik and Bipin Kakkar, for other undisclosed non-business purposes. That during the year 1998 also the above Executive Directors of M/s. Morepen Labs Ltd. had adopted a similar modus-operandi in collusion with some other unknown persons/Chartered Accountants and applied for bank finance to the tune of `200 lacs for purchase of machineries and equipments with an object to divert bank finance for undisclosed non-business orders, invoices and bills of fictitious suppliers, i.e. M/s. B.K. Chemi- Plant Industries and M/s. Flexon Hose and Engineering Co. Pvt. Ltd. and caused the bank to release loan of `200 lacs for the purpose of procurement of machineries and equipments to be installed in their factory works situated in Distt. Solan (HP). The bank loan thus released by Punjab & Sind Bank (Hire- Purchase Branch), Connaught Circus, New Delhi was not actually used for the purpose stated in the loan proposal rather the pay orders issued by the bank in the name of fictitious suppliers M/s. Chemi-Plant Industries and M/s. Flexon Hose and Engineering Co. Pvt. Ltd. were deposited in fictitious accounts opened in the above name and style at Bank of Rajasthan, Kamla Nagar Branch, Delhi and encashed. No suppliers of machineries and equipments were made by M/s. B.K. Chemi-Plant Industries and M/s. Flexon Hose and Engineering Co. Pvt. Ltd. to M/s. Morepen Labs. Ltd. and bank finance availed by the company for the said purpose were again used for some undisclosed non-business purposes. The above facts and circumstances disclose the commission of offences u/s 120-B, IPC r/w 420, 409, 468 and 471 IPC and substantive offences thereunder against Chartered Accountants S/Sh. Sanjay Malik and Bipin Kakkar and S/Sh. K.B. Suri, Sushil Suri and Smt. Kanta Suri, Executive Directors of M/s. Morepen Labs. Ltd., New Delhi and other unknown persons. 3 Therefore, a regular case is registered and entrusted to Sh. A.K. Singh, Dy. SP/SIU-VII, for investigation."" 4.The Company is a public limited company, engaged in the manufacturing of pharmaceutical products. In order to run its affairs, from time to time, the Company had been raising funds from different sources, like loans from different banks/financial institutions as also from the open market by way of `public issues', `rights issues' and `bonds' etc. Investigations revealed that in the year 1998, the Company, through its directors, including the appellant in this appeal, applied for a hire purchase advance of `2 crores from Punjab and Sind Bank (for short ""PSB""), Hire Purchase Branch, New Delhi, for purchase of various machinery items to be installed at their manufacturing units at different places. It transpired that the machinery for which the loan was raised from PSB was never purchased by the Company and, in fact, to defraud PSB, photographs of the existing/some other machinery were taken by affixing labels of PSB and the same were filed with PSB, as confirmation for having purchased the machinery, for which the loan was raised under the hire purchase limit. It was discovered that although the loan taken by the Company from PSB had been repaid, but the Company never purchased any machinery, utilising the funds disbursed by PSB against the purchase of machinery. Furthermore, the value of the machinery, purportedly purchased with these funds, was reflected in the balance-sheet of the Company and even depreciation on the said machinery, amounting to `52,33,066/-, was 4 also claimed in the Income Tax Return/Minimum Alternate Tax (MAT) for the assessment year 1998-1999, without any such machinery having been actually acquired. 5.In the year 1999, the Company and its directors again applied for hire purchase advance of `3 crores from PSB for purchase of more machines. In their balance-sheet for the assessment year 1999-2000, the Company again claimed the benefit of depreciation in the Income Tax/Minimum Alternate Tax amounting to `1,44,88,605/- although no such machinery was purchased by the Company. It further transpired that loan proposals were supported by forged proforma invoices, purportedly issued by some suppliers in whose name fictitious bank accounts were opened to encash the Demand Drafts/Pay Orders issued by PSB in favour of these firms. The investigations thus, revealed that the appellant and a number of other persons had committed the afore-mentioned offences. Accordingly, a Chargesheet was filed by the CBI on 13th October, 2004 in the Court of Chief Metropolitan Magistrate, Delhi. 6.The Chief Metropolitan Magistrate took cognizance of the offences and summoned the accused to stand trial. On being so summoned, the appellant filed the afore-stated petition under Section 482 of the Cr.P.C., praying for quashing of the Chargesheet mainly on the ground that once the Company had repaid the loan to PSB along with interest, no loss was caused to PSB and, therefore, they had not committed any offence for which Chargesheet 5 had been filed. In support of the said plea, decision of this Court in Nikhil Merchant Vs. Central Bureau of Investigation & Anr.1 was pressed into service. On behalf of the CBI, it was pleaded that the appellant and others, by forging documents/vouchers to show purchase of machinery, a pre- condition for release of instalments of loan, had not only duped PSB but also defrauded the revenue by claiming depreciation on non-existent machinery and in the process cheated the public exchequer of crores of rupees. 7.As already stated, the High Court has come to the conclusion that merely because the Company and its directors had repaid the loan to PSB they could not be exonerated of the offences committed by forging/fabricating the documents with the intention of defrauding the bank as well as the exchequer. The High Court was of the view that the ratio of the decision of this Court in Rumi Dhar (Smt) Vs. State of West Bengal & Anr.2 , was applicable on the facts of the present case and the decision of this Court in Nikhil Merchant (supra) was clearly distinguishable on facts. Thus, the High Court held that on the peculiar facts of the case, the appellant was not entitled to any relief. Accordingly, the petition filed by the appellant was dismissed with costs. He was directed to appear before the trial court. Aggrieved thereby, the appellant is before us in this appeal. 8.Mr. Vijay Aggarwal, learned counsel appearing on behalf of the appellant assailed the judgment of the High Court on the ground that all the dues, as 1 (2008) 9 SCC 677 2 (2009) 6 SCC 364 6 claimed by PSB having been paid by the debtor Company without demur, more so, when the Bank had not initiated any action for the recovery of money, the case of the appellant is on a much stronger footing as compared to the case of Nikhil Merchant (supra), wherein this Court had quashed the criminal proceedings initiated against the borrower in view of their compromise with the Bank. It was contended that since in the present case, there is no allegation that the appellant had committed any offence under the Prevention of Corruption Act 1988, at best, the allegation in the Chargesheet may attract Section 420 of the IPC, which offence is otherwise compoundable under Section 320 of the Cr.P.C. It was asserted that full amount in question having been paid to the Bank, there was no monetary loss to the Bank and, therefore, continuation of criminal proceedings against all the accused, including the appellant, would not only be an exercise in futility but an abuse of the process of law as well. It was thus, pleaded that it was a fit case where the High Court should have exercised its jurisdiction under Section 482 of the Cr.P.C. and quashed the Chargesheet. In support, while relying heavily on the decision in Nikhil Merchant (supra), learned counsel also commended us to the decisions of this Court in B.S. Joshi & Ors. Vs. State of Haryana & Anr.3 and Madan Mohan Abbot Vs. State of Punjab4 . The decision in Rumi Dhar (supra) relied upon by the High Court, was sought to be distinguished by submitting that in that case the provisions 3 (2003) 4 SCC 675 4 (2008) 4 SCC 582 7 of the Prevention of Corruption Act, 1988 had been invoked; the Bank had to file a suit for recovery of the amount due to it and the Revision Petition filed against framing of charge against the accused in that case had also been dismissed, which is not the case here. 9.Per contra, Mr. H.P. Rawal, learned Additional Solicitor General of India, appearing for the CBI, supporting the impugned judgment, strenuously urged that having regard to the nature of the allegations against the appellant, based on the evidence collected during the course of investigations, the High Court has rightly refused to exercise its jurisdiction under Section 482 of the Cr.P.C. Relying on a decision of this Court in Central Bureau of Investigation Vs. A. Ravishankar Prasad & Ors.5 , learned counsel contended that overwhelming material is available on record which clearly shows that the Company and its directors, including the appellant, and other persons had conspired to forge, fabricate and use documents in order to avail loan from the bank and had opened or caused to be opened fictitious bank accounts in the names of the suppliers to encash the pay orders/demand drafts issued by PSB and played fraud with PSB as also on the public exchequer by claiming depreciation on the machinery, which was never purchased. It was argued that the offences for which the appellant has been Chargesheeted would survive irrespective of discharge of debt of PSB by the Company. Relying on the decision of this Court in 5 ( 2009) 6 SCC 351 8 Sajjan Kumar Vs. Central Bureau of Investigation6 , learned counsel asserted that when the material on record is per se sufficient for the Court to form an opinion that the accused have committed the offences alleged against them and frame the said charges, there is no reason why the Chargesheet against the appellant should be quashed at such a preliminary stage when he has only been summoned to stand trial. 10.Before embarking on an evaluation of the rival submissions, it would be instructive to briefly notice the scope and ambit of the inherent powers of the High Court under Section 482 of the Cr.P.C. 11. Section 482 of the Cr.P.C. itself envisages three circumstances under which the inherent jurisdiction may be exercised by the High Court, namely: (i) to give effect to an order under the Cr.P.C .; (ii) to prevent an abuse of the process of Court; and (iii) to otherwise secure the ends of justice. It is trite that although the power possessed by the High Court under the said provision is very wide but it is not unbridled. It has to be exercised sparingly, carefully and cautiously, ex debito justitiae to do real and substantial justice for which alone the Court exists. Nevertheless, it is neither feasible nor desirable to lay down any inflexible rule which would govern the exercise of inherent jurisdiction of the Court. Yet, in numerous cases, this Court has laid down certain broad principles which may be borne in mind while exercising jurisdiction under Section 482 of the Cr.P.C. 6 (2010) 9 SCC 368 9 Though it is emphasised that exercise of inherent powers would depend on the facts and circumstances of each case, but, the common thread which runs through all the decisions on the subject is that the Court would be justified in invoking its inherent jurisdiction where the allegations made in the Complaint or Chargesheet, as the case may be, taken at their face value and accepted in their entirety do not constitute the offence alleged. 12.In one of the earlier cases in R.P. Kapur Vs. State of Punjab7 this Court had culled out some of the categories of cases where the inherent powers under Section 482 of the Cr.P.C. could be exercised by the High Court to quash criminal proceedings against the accused. These are: ""(i) where it manifestly appears that there is a legal bar against the institution or continuance of the proceedings e.g. want of sanction; (ii) where the allegations in the first information report or the complaint taken at their face value and accepted in their entirety do not constitute the offence alleged; (iii) where the allegations constitute an offence, but there is no legal evidence adduced or the evidence adduced clearly or manifestly fails to prove the charge."" 13.In Dinesh Dutt Joshi Vs. State of Rajasthan & Anr.8 , while explaining the object and purpose of Section 482 of the Cr.P.C., this Court had observed thus: ""6.......The principle embodied in the section is based upon the maxim: quando lex aliquid alicui concedit, concedere videtur 7 AIR 1960 SC 866 8 (2001) 8 SCC 570 1 et id sine quo res ipsae esse non potest i.e. when the law gives anything to anyone, it gives also all those things without which the thing itself would be unavailable. The section does not confer any new power, but only declares that the High Court possesses inherent powers for the purposes specified in the section. As lacunae are sometimes found in procedural law, the section has been embodied to cover such lacunae wherever they are discovered. The use of extraordinary powers conferred upon the High Court under this section are however required to be reserved, as far as possible, for extraordinary cases."" 14.Recently, this Court in A. Ravishankar Prasad & Ors. (supra), relied upon by learned counsel for the CBI, referring to several earlier decisions on the point, including R.P. Kapur (supra); State of Haryana & Ors. Vs. Bhajan Lal & Ors.9 ; Janata Dal Vs. H.S. Chowdhary & Ors.10 ; B.S. Joshi & Ors. (supra); Nikhil Merchant (supra) etc. has reiterated that the exercise of inherent powers would entirely depend on the facts and circumstances of each case. It has been further observed that the inherent powers should not be exercised to stifle a legitimate prosecution. The High Court should normally refrain from giving a prima facie decision in a case where all the facts are incomplete and hazy, more so, when the evidence has not been collected and produced before the Court and the issues involved, whether factual or legal, are of such magnitude that they cannot be seen in their true perspective without sufficient material. 15.Bearing in mind the object, scope and width of power of the High Court under Section 482 of the Cr.P.C., enunciated above, the question for 9 1992 Supp (1) SCC 335 10 (1992) 4 SCC 305 1 consideration is whether on facts in hand, the High Court was correct in law in declining to exercise its jurisdiction under the said Section? 16.Having examined the case in light of the allegations in the Chargesheet, we are of the opinion that the view taken by the High Court in the matter cannot be flawed and deserves to be affirmed. It is manifest from a bare reading of the Chargesheet, placed on record, that the gravamen of the allegations against the appellant as also the co-accused is that the Company, acting through its directors in concert with the Chartered Accountants and some other persons: (i) conceived a criminal conspiracy and executed it by forging and fabricating a number of documents, like photographs of old machines, purchase orders and invoices showing purchase of machinery in order to support their claim to avail hire purchase loan from PSB; (ii) on the strength of these false documents, PSB parted with the money by issuing pay orders & demand drafts in favour of the Company and (iii) the accused opened six fictitious accounts in the banks (four accounts in Bank of Rajasthan and two in Bank of Madura) to encash the pay orders/bank drafts issued by PSB in favour of the suppliers of machines, thereby directly rotating back the loan amount to the borrower from these fictitious accounts, and in the process committed a systematic fraud on the Bank (PSB) and obtained pecuniary advantage for themselves. Precise details of all the fictitious accounts as also the further flow of money realised on encashment of demand drafts/pay orders have been incorporated in the Chargesheet. 1 Additionally, by allegedly claiming depreciation on the new machinery, which was never purchased, on the basis of forged invoices etc.; the accused cheated the public exchequer as well. 17.As afore-stated, in the Chargesheet, the accused are alleged to have committed offences punishable under Section 120B, read with Sections 420 , 409 , 468 and 471 IPC. We feel that at this preliminary stage of proceedings, it would neither be desirable nor proper to return a final finding as to whether the essential ingredients of the said Sections are satisfied. For the purpose of the present appeal, it will suffice to observe that on a conspectus of the factual scenario, noted above, prima facie, the Chargesheet does disclose the commission of offences by the appellant under the afore-noted Sections. The essential ingredient of the offence of ""criminal conspiracy"", defined in Section 120A IPC, is the agreement to commit an offence. In a case where the agreement is for accomplishment of an act which by itself constitutes an offence, then in that event, unless the Statute so requires, no overt act is necessary to be proved by the prosecution because in such a fact-situation criminal conspiracy is established by proving such an agreement. In other words, where the conspiracy alleged is with regard to commission of a serious crime of the nature as contemplated in Section 120B read with the proviso to sub-section (2) of Section 120A IPC, then in that event mere proof of an agreement between the accused for commission of such crime alone is enough to bring about a conviction under Section 1 120B and the proof of any overt act by the accused or by any one of them would not be necessary. (See: Suresh Chandra Bahri Vs. State of Bihar11 ). 18.Similarly, the definition of ""forgery"" in Section 463 IPC is very wide. The basic elements of forgery are: (i) the making of a false document or part of it and (ii) such making should be with such intention as is specified in the Section viz. (a) to cause damage or injury to (i) the public, or (ii) any person; or (b) to support any claim or title; or (c) to cause any person to part with property; or (d) to cause any person to enter into an express or implied contract; or (e) to commit fraud or that fraud may be committed. As stated above, in the instant case more than sufficient circumstances exist suggesting the hatching of criminal conspiracy and forgery of several documents leading to commission of the aforementioned Sections. We refrain from saying more on the subject at this juncture, lest it may cause prejudice to the appellant or the prosecution. 19.We may now advert to the decision of this Court in the case of Nikhil Merchant (supra), on which great emphasis was laid, on behalf of the appellant. In that case a Chargesheet was filed by the CBI against the accused under Section 120B read with Sections 420 , 467 , 468 , 471 IPC read with Sections 5(2) and 5(1)(d) of the Prevention of Corruption Act, 1947 and Section 13(2) read with Section 13(1)(d) of the Prevention of Corruption Act, 1988. The allegation under the Chargesheet was that the accused 11 1995 Supp (1) SCC 80 1 persons had conspired with each other in fraudulently diverting the funds of the Bank. Offence alleging forgery was also included in the Chargesheet. In the meantime, the suit for recovery of money filed by the Bank against the Company, to which the appellant in that case was also a party, was disposed of on a written compromise arrived at between the parties. Consequent upon the compromise of the suit and having regard to the contents of clause 11 of the consent terms, which stipulated that neither party had any claim against the other and parties were withdrawing all allegations and counter allegations made against each other, the said appellant filed an application for discharge. The application was rejected by the trial court. A petition preferred under Section 482 of the Cr.P.C. was also dismissed by the High Court. In further appeal to this Court, accepting the contention of the appellant that this Court could transcend the limitation imposed under Section 320 of the Cr.P.C. and pass orders quashing criminal proceedings even where non compoundable offences were involved, quashing the criminal proceedings the Court observed thus: ""30. In the instant case, the disputes between the Company and the Bank have been set at rest on the basis of the compromise arrived at by them whereunder the dues of the Bank have been cleared and the Bank does not appear to have any further claim against the Company. What, however, remains is the fact that certain documents were alleged to have been created by the appellant herein in order to avail of credit facilities beyond the limit to which the Company was entitled. The dispute involved herein has overtones of a civil dispute with certain criminal facets. The question which is required to be answered in this case is whether the power which independently lies with this 1 Court to quash the criminal proceedings pursuant to the compromise arrived at, should at all be exercised? 31. On an overall view of the facts as indicated hereinabove and keeping in mind the decision of this Court in B.S. Joshi case and the compromise arrived at between the Company and the Bank as also Clause 11 of the consent terms filed in the suit filed by the Bank, we are satisfied that this is a fit case where technicality should not be allowed to stand in the way in the quashing of the criminal proceedings, since, in our view, the continuance of the same after the compromise arrived at between the parties would be a futile exercise."" [Emphasis supplied] 20.A bare reading of the afore-extracted paragraphs would indicate that the question posed for consideration in that case was with regard to the power of this Court under Article 142 of the Constitution of India to quash the criminal proceedings in the facts and circumstances of a given case and not in relation to the powers of the High Court under Section 482 of the Cr.P.C. The Court came to the conclusion that it was a fit case where it should exercise its powers under Article 142 of the Constitution. In our opinion, Nikhil Merchant (supra) does not hold as an absolute proposition of law that whenever a dispute between the parties, having overtones of a civil dispute with criminal facets is settled between them, continuance of criminal proceedings would be an exercise in futility and, therefore, should be quashed. Similarly, in B.S. Joshi & Ors. (supra), which has been relied upon in Nikhil Merchant (supra), the question for consideration was whether the High Court in exercise of its inherent powers can quash criminal proceedings or FIR or Complaint for offences which are not compoundable 1 under Section 320 of the Cr.P.C. It was held that Section 320 cannot limit or affect the powers of the High Court under Section 482 of the Cr.P.C., a well settled proposition of law. We are of the opinion that Nikhil Merchant (supra) as also the other two judgments relied upon on behalf of the appellant are clearly distinguishable on facts. It needs little emphasis that even one additional or different fact may make a world of difference between the conclusions in two cases and blindly placing reliance on a decision is never proper. It is trite that while applying ratio, the Court may not pick out a word or sentence from the judgment divorced from the context in which the said question arose for consideration. (See: Zee Telefilms Ltd. & Anr. Vs. Union of India & Anr.12 ). In this regard, the following words of Lord Denning, quoted in Haryana Financial Corporation & Anr. Vs. Jagdamba Oil Mills & Anr.13 , are also quite apt: ""Each case depends on its own facts and a close similarity between one case and another is not enough because even a single significant detail may alter the entire aspect. In deciding such cases, one should avoid the temptation to decide cases (as said by Cardozo) by matching the colour of one case against the colour of another. To decide, therefore, on which side of the line a case falls, the broad resemblance to another case is not at all decisive."" 21. In the present case, having regard to the modus operandi adopted by the accused, as projected in the Chargesheet and briefly referred to in para 17 (supra), we have no hesitation in holding that it is not a fit case for exercise 12 (2005) 4 SCC 649 13 (2002) 3 SCC 496 1 of jurisdiction by the High Court under Section 482 of the Cr.P.C. as also by this Court under Article 142 of the Constitution of India. As noted above, the accused had not only duped PSB, they had also availed of depreciation on the machinery, which was never purchased and used by them, causing loss to the exchequer, a serious economic offence against the society. 22.The view we have taken above, gets fortified by a recent decision of this Court in Rumi Dhar (supra), wherein while dealing with a fact situation, akin to the present case, referring to the decision in Nikhil Merchant (supra), the Court declined to quash criminal proceedings in that case , observing thus: ""24. The jurisdiction of the Court under Article 142 of the Constitution of India is not in dispute. Exercise of such power would, however, depend on the facts and circumstances of each case. The High Court, in exercise of its jurisdiction under Section 482 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, and this Court, in terms of Article 142 of the Constitution of India, would not direct quashing of a case involving crime against the society particularly when both the learned Special Judge as also the High Court have found that a prima facie case has been made out against the appellant herein for framing the charge."" 23.We respectfully concur with the afore-extracted observations. In the final analysis, we hold that merely because the dues of the bank have been paid up, the appellant cannot be exonerated from the criminal liability. Therefore, the Chargesheet against him cannot be quashed. 1 24.In view of the foregoing discussion, we do not find any merit in this appeal and it is dismissed accordingly. The Trial Court shall now proceed with the case as expeditiously as possible without being influenced by any observations made by the High Court or in this judgment on the merits of the Chargesheet. ...........................................

Supreme Court of India Mahadev Govind Gharge & Ors vs Spl.Land Acq Offcier Ukp.Jamkhandi Kar on 10 May, 2011 Bench: Swatanter Kumar , Asok Kumar Ganguly REPORTABLE IN THE SUPREME COURT OF INDIA CIVIL APPELLATE JURISDICTION CIVIL APPEAL NOs.5094 OF 2005 Mahadev Govind Gharge & others ..Appellant(s) - Versus - The Special Land Acquisition Officer, Upper Krishna Project, Jamkhandi, Karnataka .. Respondent(s) WITH CIVIL APPEAL NO. 5113 OF 2005 The Special Land Acquisition Officer, Upper Krishna Project, Jamkhandi .. Appellant(s) - Versus - Mahadev Govind Gharge & others ..Respondent(s) J U D G M E N T GANGULY, J. 1. Interesting questions involving interpretation of Order XLI Rule 22 of the Civil Procedure Code (hereinafter "" CPC "") fall for 1 decision in this case in which the relevant facts are that a preliminary notification under section 4(1) of the Land Acquisition Act, 1894 (hereinafter referred to as `the Act') was issued on 24.4.1997, for acquisition of land in Survey No. 616/1/1 measuring 2 acres 29 guntas and in Survey No. 616/1B/1 measuring 1 acre 2 guntas. The award was passed by the Special Land Acquisition Officer on 13.04.1999; he considered the land acquired to be dry land and fixed compensation amount at the rate of Rs.31,650/- per acre. 2. Aggrieved, the claimants (landowners) filed references under section 18 of the Act. The Reference Court enhanced compensation to Rs.3,50,000/- per acre, along with all statutory benefits. 3. The respondents filed an appeal against the judgment of the Reference Court to the High Court of Karnataka on 12.09.2001. The landowners were on a caveat. The High Court admitted the appeal on the same day and directed the office to post the same for hearing immediately after LCR were received. On 19.11.2002, the appellants filed cross-objections before the High Court, under Order XLI, Rule 22 of CPC , along with an 2 application for condonation of delay of 404 days in filing the cross-objections. 4. On 22.10.2003, the High Court, vide the first impugned judgment, dismissed the appeal of the State holding that the point for consideration in the appeal was squarely covered by the judgment of that court dated 12.8.2003 in M.F.A. No. 3278 of 2001, as a result of which the appeal was liable to be dismissed. The High Court also held that the landowners were entitled to interest with effect from the date of the award, i.e. from 13.4.1999. Against the said judgment, the State came up in the present appeal before this court i.e. Civil Appeal No. 5113 of 2005. 5. On the same day, the High Court, vide the second impugned judgment, also dismissed the cross objections filed by the landowners. In the appeal dismissing the cross objections, two points came up for consideration before the High Court: (i) Whether the limitation period of one month prescribed under Order XLI Rule 22 (1) of CPC shall run from 12.9.2001 as contended by learned government advocate or from the date 3 of service of notice of date of hearing of appeal fixed by the court, as contended by the learned advocate of the landowner. (ii) If the limitation of one month prescribed under Order XLI Rule 22(1) of CPC did not begin to run with effect from 12.9.2001, whether the alternative argument by way of explanation offered by the cross objectors would constitute `sufficient cause' warranting condonation of delay in filing the cross objection? 6. The High Court stated that the Division Bench had admitted the appeal on 12.9.2001 and had also stayed the operation of the impugned award subject to the land acquisition officer depositing 50% of the enhanced compensation with statutory benefits. On the same day, the Division Bench had directed the office to list the appeal for final hearing after the records were received. Accordingly, the office called for the records and they were received by the office. Subsequently, on 25.1.2002, the Division Bench permitted the cross objectors to move for an early hearing of the appeal. It held as follows: ""Therefore, it is quite clear that on 12.9.2001 itself, the Division Bench thought it appropriate to hear the appeals out of turn and accordingly directed the office to post the appeal for hearing 4 immediately after the records are received. The submission of Sri Kalagi that since the Division Bench did not fix a particular date for final hearing of the appeal, it would not satisfy the requirement of Order XLI Rule 22(1) CPC , is not acceptable to us. We can take judicial notice of the fact that quite often courts direct the final hearing of the matters out of turn or in regular course without fixing a specific date for final hearing of cases. Once an order is made by the court for final hearing, the registry, in compliance with the direction and having regard to the workload of the court concerned, would post cases for final hearing. Therefore, it could not be said that the Division Bench did not direct final hearing of the appeal on 12.9.2001. The language implied by the Division Bench would go to show that the High Court wanted the registry to post the appeal for final hearing out of turn immediately after the records were received. It is quite apparent from the records that the cross objection was not filed either within one month from the date of fixing the date of the appeal or from the date the records of the lower court were received by the registry of this court. Therefore, the cross objectors' contention based on the provisions of Order XLI Rule 22(1) CPC is misconceived and untenable."" 7. On the second point, the High Court was of the opinion that the explanation offered by the cross objectors for the delay of 404 days was vague and did not amount to sufficient cause so as to condone the delay. Consequently, the cross objections were dismissed. 5 8. Thus, the landowners (cross objectors) approached this court by filing Civil Appeal No. 5094 of 2005 against the impugned judgment of the High Court. 9. Both the appeals were heard together by this Court. 10. Before this court, the landowners in their appeal (Civil Appeal No. 5094 of 2005), raised the following contentions: a. The limitation period of one month, prescribed under Order XLI Rule 22, would not begin to run till an actual date was fixed for hearing by the High Court and notice of it was served on the cross objectors, i.e. landowners. b. Powers of an Appellate Court are very wide under Order XLI Rule 33 and relief could be granted to the landowners even under the said provision. c. The landowners had shown sufficient cause for the delay. d. Land of the landowners was compulsorily acquired and the court was duty bound to award just compensation to the landowners. 11. The State, in its appeal (Civil Appeal No. 5113 of 2005), contended as follows: a. The High Court wrongly dismissed the appeal by relying on M.F.A. No. 3278 of 2001 since there was absence of evidence to show that the land 6 in question and the land covered by the said judgment were similar in all respects. b. The High Court erred in awarding interest from the date of the award and the same was contrary to section 28 of the Act. 12. We have heard the parties and perused the material on record. 13. Rule 22(1) makes it clear that the limitation for filing a cross-objection is one month from the date of service of notice of date fixed for the hearing of appeal. The relevant provision read as follows: 22. Upon hearing respondent may object to decree as if he had preferred a separate appeal- (1) Any respondent, though he may not have appealed from any part of the decree, may not only support the decree but may also state that the finding against him in the court below in respect of any issue ought to have been in his favour; and may also take any cross-objection to the decree which he could have taken by way of appeal provided he has filed such objection in the Appellate Court within one month from the date of service on him or his pleader of notice of the day fixed for hearing the appeal, or within such further time as the Appellate Court may see fit to allow. Explanation- A respondent aggrieved by a finding of the court in the judgment on which the decree appealed against is based may, under this rule, file cross-objection in respect of the decree in so far as it is based on that finding, notwithstanding that by 7 reason of the decision of the court on any other finding which is sufficient for the decision of the suit, the decree, is, wholly or in part, in favour of that respondent. 14. Notice of this Court was drawn to the judgments of different High Courts where the provisions of Order XLI Rule 22 of CPC came up for consideration. 15. In the case of Rashida Begum (since deceased now represented through LRs) v. Union of India reported in 91 (2001) Delhi Law Times 664 (DB), the High Court while considering other judgments of the same High Court in Union of India v. Jhutter Singh [46 (1992) DLT 364] and Union of India v. Shibu Ram Mittal [1999 (49) DRJ 166] held that limitation for the purpose of filing cross objection under Order XLI, Rule 22 will run only after the appellate court has fixed the date of hearing of the appeal and notice thereof has been served on the respondent or his pleader. In coming to the said conclusion, the courts sought to make a distinction between the date of hearing of the appeal under Order XLI, Rule 11 and date for hearing of the appeal under Order XLI, Rule 12. 8 16. In Shibu Ram Mittal (supra), the Division Bench of the Delhi High Court specifically held as follows: ""9. A bare perusal of the relevant provisions contained in Sub-Rule (1) of Rule 22 of Order XLI C.P.C makes it clear that the limitation would begin to run from the date of service of notice on the respondent or his pleader of the day fixed for hearing of the appeal. A notice informing the respondent that an appeal has been admitted against him and intimating a Farzi (tentative) date of hearing cannot be taken as the notice envisaged under this provision. The provision is specific- ""notice of the date fixed for hearing the appeal"". A Farzi date cannot be said to be the date fixed for hearing the appeal. Simply because a counsel appeared for the respondents does not displace the requirement of service of notice of actual date of hearing of appeal. The emphasis on the words ""notice of date fixed for hearing an appeal"" cannot be allowed to be diluted. The provision ensures that the appellant has advance notice before the hearing of the appeal about the cross objections by the respondent."" 17. In the case of Karnataka State Road Transport Corporation v. R. Sethuram & Anr. , reported in AIR 1996 Karnataka 380, the Karnataka High Court has taken a similar view by holding that the provisions of limitation are to be strictly construed and the rule does not speak of limitation from the date of knowledge of appeal, rather it speaks of limitation from the date of service of notice which would 9 indicate the date of fixation of hearing of appeal by the High Court. 18. However, a different view has been taken by the Rajasthan High Court in the case of The East India Hotels Ltd. v. Smt. Mahendra Kumari and another , reported in AIR 2008 Raj. 131. In the said case, the cross objector has put in his appearance before the High Court and a caveat had been lodged even before admission of the appeal. It also appears that the counsel was present and the appeal was admitted in his presence. Under those circumstances, the High Court held that notice prescribed under Order XLI, Rule 14 was not be essential to be served upon the respondents who participated in the proceedings. 19. De hors the facts of the present case, it will be appropriate for us to examine the legislative scheme as well as the principles governing the application of Order XLI and its various rules of the Code of Civil Procedure , 1908 (in short the `Code'). The Code is a law relating to procedure and procedural law is always intended to facilitate the process of achieving the ends of justice. The Courts would normally favour the 10 interpretation which will achieve the said object. In the case of Sardar Amarjit Singh Kalra (dead) by LRs., v. Pramod Gupta (Smt. ) (dead) by LRs. and others [2003 (3) SCC 272], a Constitution Bench of this court held, ""laws of procedure are meant to regulate effectively, assist and aid the object of doing substantial and real justice and not to foreclose even an adjudication on merits of substantial rights of citizen under personal, property and other laws. Procedure has always been viewed as the handmaid of justice and not meant to hamper the cause of justice or sanctify miscarriage of justice."" 20. Similar views are also expressed by this Court in the case of The State of Punjab and another v. Shamlal Murari and another [(1976) 1 SCC 719] where the Court held as under: - ""...We must always remember that processual law is not to be a tyrant but a servant, not an obstruction but an aid to justice. It has been wisely observed that procedural prescriptions are the handmaid and not the mistress, a lubricant, not a resistant in the administration of justice. Where the non-compliance, tho' procedural, will thwart fair hearing or prejudice doing of justice to parties, the rule is mandatory. But, grammar apart, if the breach can be corrected without injury to a just disposal of the case, we should not enthrone a 11 regulatory requirement into a dominant desideratum. After all, courts are to do justice, not to wreck this end product on technicalities..."" 21. Order XLI of the Code deals with appeals from original decrees. Rules 1 and 2 give the right to file an appeal against a decree in the manner and on the grounds specified therein. Rule 3 provides for rejection of the memorandum of appeal. Rule 3A which was added by the Amendment Act 104 of 1976 (w.e.f. February 1, 1977) provides for application for condonation of delay where the appeal is filed beyond the period of limitation. Rule 5 defines power of the Court to grant stay, conditional or otherwise, of the decree under appeal. Rule 11 is an important provision which requires the Appellate Court to fix a day for hearing the appellant or his pleader and, on hearing, it may even dismiss the appeal at that very stage. The expression `after fixing a date for hearing the appellant' is of some significance. It obviously means that the Court should fix a date for hearing the appellant on the merits of the appeal. The hearing contemplated under Rule 11 is not an empty formality but denotes the substantive right of being heard, 12 available to the appellant(s). The Court has to apply its mind to the merits of the appeal and then alone the Court can pass an order of dismissal. In terms of Rule 12, unless the Appellate Court dismisses the appeal under Rule 11, it shall fix a day for hearing of the appeal. The hearing contemplated under Rule 12 is normally called `final hearing'. Between the day of hearing fixed under Rule 11 and that fixed under Rule 12 there is a requirement to issue notice to the respondent(s). Besides this two other aspects need to be highlighted. First is that Rule 11A of the Code requires the Court to hear the appeal under Rule 11 as expeditiously as possible and to conclude such hearing within 60 days from the date on which the memorandum of appeal is filed. Second is that the fixation of the appeal for hearing under Rule 12 would be on such day which the court may fix with reference to the current business of the court. As is evident, the intention of the legislature is to ensure expeditious disposal of the appeals keeping in mind the heavy burden on the courts. The Appellate Court is vested with very wide powers including framing of additional issues, permitting additional evidence, remanding a case, pronouncing 13 judgments in accordance with law and even admitting an appeal for re-hearing where the appeal was dismissed in default. The provisions of Rule 22 which have been reproduced by us above gives right to a respondent to file cross-objections to the decree under appeal which he could have taken by way of an appeal. This right is available to the respondent provided he had filed such objections in the Appellate Court within one month from the date of service on him or his pleader of notice of the day fixed for hearing the appeal, or within such further time as the Appellate Court may see fit to allow. 22. A bare reading of the provisions of Rule 22 clearly show that they do not provide for any consequences, leave any adverse consequence, in the event the respondent-cross objector defaults in filing the cross objections within the statutory period of one month. On the contrary they provide that the cross objections can be filed within such further time as the Court may see fit to allow. The expression `or within such further time as the court may see fit to allow' clearly shows that wide judicial discretion is vested in the courts to permit the filing of the cross-objections even after the expiry of 14 30 days or for that matter any period which, in the facts and circumstances of the case, is found to be just and proper by the Court. 23. Rule 22 is not only silent on the consequences flowing from such default from filing appeal within one month, from the period fixed hereunder, but it even clothes the Court with power to take on record the cross-objections even after the expiry of the said period. Thus, right of the cross-objector is not taken away in absolute terms in case of such default. The Courts exercise this power vested in them by virtue of specific language of Rule 22 itself and thus, its provisions must receive a liberal construction. 24. Maxwell on The Interpretation of Statutes, (12th Edn., by P. St. J. Langan), states as follows:- ""A reference to the power of a court being exercisable ""at any time thereafter"" will receive a literal construction { L. v. L. [1962] P.101}. But where something is to be done ""forthwith"" by some person or body, a court will not require instantaneous compliance with the statutory requirement [Sameen v. Abeyewickrema (1963) A.C. 597] "" `Forthwith,' "" Harman L.J. has said, ""is not a precise time and, provided that no harm is done, `forthwith' means any 15 reasonable time thereafter,"" and so may, according to the circumstances, involve action within days or years [Hillingdon London Borough Council v. Cutler (1968) 1 Q.B. 124]"" 25. Such provisions should be construed on their plain meaning and it may not be necessary for the Court to bring into service other principles of statutory interpretation. However, the maxim De minimis non curat lex shall apply to such statutory provisions. 26. Bennion on Statutory Interpretation (5th Edn., 2008, at page 55) states that ""Where discretion exists The Court will be more willing to hold that a statutory requirement is merely directory if any breach of the requirement is necessarily followed by an opportunity to exercise some judicial or official discretion in a way which can adequately compensate for that breach."" 27. In the case of Kailash v. Nanhku & others , [(2005) 4 SCC 480], a Bench of three Judges of this Court while interpreting the provisions of Order VIII Rule 1 of the Code, which has more stringent language and provides no such 16 discretion to extend the limitation as provided to the Courts in Order XLI Rule 22, had observed that despite the use of such language in the provisions of Order VIII Rule 1 of the Code, the judicial discretion to extend the limitation contained therein has been a matter of legal scrutiny for quite some time but now the law is well settled that in special circumstances, the Court can even extend the time beyond the 90 days as specified therein and held as under: ""The object is to expedite the hearing and not to scuttle the same. The process of justice may be speeded up and hurried but the fairness which is a basic element of justice cannot be permitted to be buried... In an adversarial system, no party should ordinarily be denied the opportunity of participating in the process of justice dispensation. Unless compelled by express and specific language of the statute, the provisions of CPC or any other procedural enactment ought not to be construed in a manner which would leave the court helpless to meet extraordinary situations in the ends of justice."" 28. Thus, it is an undisputed principle of law that the procedural laws are primarily intended to achieve the ends of justice and, normally, not to shut the doors of justice for the 17 parties at the very threshold. We have already noticed that there is no indefeasible divestment of right of the cross-objector in case of a delay and his rights to file cross-objections are protected even at a belated stage by the discretion vested in the Courts. But at the same time, the Court cannot lose sight of the fact that meaning of `ends of justice' essentially refers to justice for all the parties involved in the litigation. It will be unfair to give an interpretation to a provision to vest a party with a right at the cost of the other, particularly, when statutory provisions do not so specifically or even impliedly provide for the same. The provisions of Order XLI Rule 22 of the Code are akin to the provisions of the Limitation Act, 1963 , i.e. when such provisions bar a remedy, by efflux of time, to one party, it gives consequential benefit to the opposite party. Before such vested benefit can be taken away, the Court has to strike a balance between respective rights of the parties on the plain reading of the statutory provision to meet the ends of justice. If a cross-objector fails to file cross-objections within the stipulated time, then his right to file cross-objections is taken away only in a limited sense. To that extent a benefit is 18 granted to the other party, i.e. the appellant, of having their appeal heard without such cross-objections. Still, however, if the Court is of the opinion that it is just and proper to permit the filing of cross-objection even after the expiry of the statutory limitation of one month, it is certainly vested with power to grant the same, but of course, only after hearing the other party. That is how the rights of the parties are to be balanced in consonance with the scheme of Order XLI Rule 22 of the Code. 29. In Justice G.P. Singh's Principles of Statutory Interpretation (11th Edn., 2008), the learned author while referring to judgments of different Courts states (at page 134) that procedural laws regulating proceedings in court are to be construed as to render justice wherever reasonably possible and to avoid injustice from a mistake of court. He further states (at pages 135 and 136) that: ""Consideration of hardship, injustice or absurdity as avoiding a particular construction is a rule which must be applied with great care. ""The argument ab inconvenienti"", said LORD MOULTON, ""is one which requires to be used with great caution""."" 19 30. The learned author while referring to the judgments of this Court in the case of Sangram Singh v. Election Tribunal, Kotah [(1955) 2 SCR 1] recorded (at page 384) that ""while considering the non-compliance with a procedural requirement, it has to be kept in view that such a requirement is designed to facilitate justice and further its ends and therefore, if the consequence of non-compliance is not provided, the requirement may be held to be directory..."" 31. This Court in the case of Byram Pestonji Gariwala v. Union Bank of India & others [(1992) 1 SCC 31] referred to Crawford's Statutory Construction (para 254) to say that: ""Statutes relating to remedies and procedure must receive a liberal construction 'especially so as to secure a more effective, a speedier, a simpler, and a less expensive administration of law'."" 32. The consistent view taken by this Court is that the provisions of a statute are normally construed to achieve the ends of justice, advance the interest of public and to avoid multiplicity of litigation. In the case of Dondapati Narayana Reddy v. Duggireddy Venkatanarayana Reddy & others 20 [2001 (8) SCC 115], this Court expressed similar view in relation to amendment of pleadings. The principles stated in this judgment may aptly be applied generally in relation to the interpretation of provisions of the Code. Strict construction of a procedural law is called for where there is complete extinguishment of rights, as opposed to the cases where discretion is vested in the courts to balance the equities between the parties to meet the ends of justice which would invite liberal construction. For example, under Order XLI Rule 22 of the Code, cross objections can be filed at any subsequent time, even after expiry of statutory period of one month, as may be allowed by the Court. Thus, it is evidently clear that there is no complete or indefeasible extinguishment of right to file cross objections after the expiry of statutory period of limitation provided under the said provision. Cross-objections within the scheme of Order XLI Rule 22 of the Code are to be treated as separate appeal and must be disposed of on same principles in accordance with the provisions of Order XLI of the Code. 33. This Court in the case of Sangram Singh (supra) while dealing with the principles of interpretation of provisions of the 21 Code, laid down three principles which have to be kept in mind while interpreting any portion of the Code and held as under: ""31. In our opinion, Wallace, J., and the other judges who adopt the same line of thought, are right. As we have already observed, our laws of procedure are based on the principle that, as far as possible, no proceeding in a Court of law should be conducted to the detriment of a person in his absence. There are of course exceptions, and this is one of them. When the defendant has been served and has been afforded an opportunity of appearing, then, if he does not appear, the Court may proceed in his absence. But, be it noted, the Court is not directed to make an ex parte order. Of course the fact that it is proceedings ex parte will be recorded in the minutes of its proceedings but that is merely a statement of the fact and is not an order made against the defendant in the sense of an ex parte decree or other ex parte order which the Court is authorised to make. All that Rule 6(1)(a) does is to remove a bar and no more. It merely authorises the Court to do that which it could not have done without this authority, namely to proceed in the absence of one of the parties. The contrast in language between rules 7 and 13 emphasises this. 34. This Court has reiterated the above dictum with approval in the case of Kailash (supra). The above-stated principles 22 require the Court to give precedence to the right of a party to put forward its case. In other words unnecessary and avoidable technical impediments should not be introduced by virtue of interpretative process. At the same time any irreparable loss should not be caused to a party on whom the right might have vested as a result of default of other party. Furthermore, the courts have to keep in mind the realities of explosion of litigation because of which the Court normally takes time to dispose of appeals. It would be a travesty of justice, if after passage of substantial time when the appeal is taken up for final hearing a cross-objector who was heard and participated in the hearing at the admission stage itself, claims that the limitation period for him to file his cross-objection will commence only from the date of service of a fresh notice on him or his pleader, in terms of Order XLI Rule 22 of the Code. Such an interpretation would jeopardize the very purpose and object of the statute and prejudicially affect the administration of justice as the appeal which has come up for final hearing and disposal would again be lost in the bundle of pending cases on this pretext. It is trite that justice must not only be 23 done but must also appear to have been done to all the parties to a lis before the Court. 35. Procedural laws, like the Code, are intended to control and regulate the procedure of judicial proceedings to achieve the objects of justice and expeditious disposal of cases. The provisions of procedural law which do not provide for penal consequences in default of their compliance should normally be construed as directory in nature and should receive liberal construction. The Court should always keep in mind the object of the statute and adopt an interpretation which would further such cause in light of attendant circumstances. 36. To put it simply, the procedural law must act as a linchpin to keep the wheel of expeditious and effective determination of dispute moving in its place. The procedural checks must achieve its end object of just, fair and expeditious justice to parties without seriously prejudicing the rights of any of them. 37. Now, we would proceed to examine the language of Order XLI Rule 22 of the Code. The stipulated period of one month is to commence from the date of service, on the concerned party 24 or his pleader, of notice of the day fixed for hearing the appeal. A cross-objection may also be filed within such further time as the Appellate Court may see fit to allow. Date of hearing 38. First and foremost, we must explain what is meant by `hearing the appeal'. Hearing of the appeal can be classified in two different stages; one at the admission stage and the other at the final stage. Date of hearing has normally been defined as the date on which the court applies its mind to the merits of the case. If the appeal is heard ex-parte for admission under Order XLI Rule 11 of the Code, the Court could dismiss it at that very stage or admit the same for regular hearing. Such appeal could be heard in the presence of the other party at the admission stage itself, particularly, in cases where a caveat is lodged by the respondent to the appeal. 39. The concept of `hearing by the Court', in fact, has common application both under Civil and Criminal jurisprudence. Even in a criminal matter the hearing of the case is said to be commenced by the Court only when it applies 25 its mind to frame a charge etc. Similarly, under civil law also it is only when the Court actually applies its mind to averments made by party/parties, it can be considered as hearing of the case. This Court in the case of Siraj Ahmad Siddiqui v. Prem Nath Kapoor [1993 (4) SCC 406] while dealing with the provisions of the U.P. Urban Buildings (Regulation of Letting, Rent & Eviction) Act, 1972 , referring to the concept of first hearing, held as under: ""13. The date of first hearing of a suit under the Code is ordinarily understood to be the date on which the court proposes to apply its mind to the contentions in the pleadings of the parties to the suit and in the documents filed by them for the purpose of framing the issues to be decided in the suit. ........................ .................................We are of the view, therefore, that the date of first hearing as defined in the said Act is the date on which the court proposes to apply its mind to determine the points in controversy between the parties to the suit and to frame issues, if necessary."" 40. The date of hearing must not be confused with the expression `step in the proceedings'. These are two different concepts of procedural law and have different connotation and 26 application. What may be a `step in the proceeding', essentially, may not mean a `hearing' by the Court. Necessary ingredients of `hearing' thus are application of mind by the court and address by the party to the suits. 41. Now we would proceed to discuss the purpose of giving one month's time and notice to the respondent to file cross- objection. The primary intention is, obviously, to give him a reasonable opportunity to file cross-objections in the appeal filed by the other party. It may be noticed that filing of cross- objections is not an exclusive but, an alternate remedy which a party can avail as alternative of filing a separate appeal in its own right. 42. The language of Order XLI Rule 22 of the Code fixes the period of limitation to be computed from the date of service of notice of hearing of the appeal upon the respondent/cross- objector and within one month of such date he has to file cross objections. Thus, the crucial point of time is the date on which the notice of hearing of the appeal is served. This could be a notice for actual date of hearing or otherwise. 27 43. There appears to be a dual purpose emerging from the language of Order XLI Rule 22 of the Code. Firstly, to grant time of one month or even such further time as the Appellate Court may see fit to allow; and secondly, to put the party or his pleader at notice that the appeal has been admitted and is fixed for hearing and the Court is going to pronounce upon the rights and contention of the parties on the merits of the appeal. Once such notice is served, the period of limitation under Order XLI Rule 22 of the Code will obviously start running from that date. If both these purposes are achieved any time prior to the service of a fresh notice then it would be an exercise in futility to issue a separate notice which is bound to result in inordinate delay in disposal of appeals which, in turn, would be prejudicial to the appellants. A law of procedure should always be construed to eliminate both these possibilities. 44. A Bench of three Judges of this Court in the case of Salem Advocate Bar Association, Tamil Nadu v. Union of India [(2003) 1 SCC 49] while examining the constitutional validity of various amended provisions of the Code, (amended or introduced by Amendment Act 46 of 1999 and Amendment 28 Act 22 of 2002) discussed requirements of Section 27 of the Code which relates to issuance of summons to the defendants to appear and answer the claim. Such summons are required to be issued within one month from the date of institution of the suit. The Court held that once steps in furtherance to issuance of summons within one month are taken by the plaintiff, then even if the summons are not served within that period, it will be substantial compliance of the provisions of Section 27 of the Code. Following dictum of the court can be usefully noticed at this stage. ""7. It was submitted by Mr. Vaidyanathan that the words ""on such day not beyond thirty days from the date of the institution of the suit"" seem to indicate that the summons must be served within thirty days of the date of the institution of the suit. In our opinion, the said provisions read as a whole will not be susceptible to that meaning. The words added by amendment, it appears, fix outer time frame, by providing that steps must be taken within thirty days from the date of the institution of the suit, to issue summons. In other words, if the suit is instituted, for example, on 1st January, 2002, then the correct addresses of the defendants and the process fee must be filed in the Court within thirty days so that summons be issued by the Court not beyond thirty days from the date of the 29 institution of the suit. The object is to avoid long delay in issue of summons for want of steps by the plaintiff. It is quite evident that if all that is required to be done by a party, has been performed within the period of thirty days, then no fault can be attributed to the party. If for any reason, the court is not in a position or is unable to or does not issue summons within thirty days, there will, in our opinion, be compliance with the provisions of Section 27 once within thirty days of the issue of the summons the party concerned has taken steps to file the process fee along with completing the other formalities which are required to enable the court to issue the summons."" 45. The learned counsel for the appellant also relied upon the judgment of this court in the case of Sushil Kumar Sabharwal v. Gurpreet Singh & others [2002 (5) SCC 377] to contend that knowledge of appeal cannot be equated to notice of date of hearing. There is no doubt that this Court in para 11 of that judgment made a distinction between the knowledge of the date of hearing and the knowledge of pendency of suit. Referring to the evidence in that case , this Court held that the version of the defendant should have been believed by the courts concerned because he was denied a reasonable opportunity to present his case before the Court. In 30 the present case this distinction is hardly of any help to the counsel for the appellant inasmuch as they have appeared and argued at the admission stage of the appeal which was admitted in their presence and an order was also passed for final hearing. 46. Adverting to the facts of the present case, as already noticed, the appellants had also filed caveat in the appeal. In law, the rights of a caveator are different from that of cross- objectors per se. In terms of Section 148A of the Code, a caveator has a right to be heard mandatorily for the purposes of passing of an interlocutory order. The law contemplates that a caveator is to be heard by the court before any interim order can be passed against him. But in the present case when the appeal was listed for hearing at the admission stage itself, the appellants had appeared and argued the matter not only in relation to grant of an interim order but also on the merits of the appeal. The High Court, on 12th of September, 2001, after applying its mind to the merits of the case had passed the following order: ""Admit. 31 Heard the counsel for the appellant and respondent. Interim stay as prayed, in I.A. II/01 subject to the appellant depositing 50% of amount awarded with all statutory benefits etc., before the reference court, within eight weeks. Respondents permitted to withdraw 25% of the amount. Remaining 25% amount shall be kept in fixed deposit for the term of six months. Call for records. List for hearing immediately after the records are received with connected cases."" 47. As is evident from the above order, the records were required to be called from the lower courts and thereafter, the appeal was to be heard finally. Though the court had not actually fixed any particular date, it had directed the appeal to be listed for hearing. Then again, vide its order dated 25th January, 2002, the High Court had directed the appellant(s) to move an application for early hearing of the appeal. On all these occasions, the appellant(s), or his pleader, was present and participated in the proceedings before the Court. Thus, the appellant(s) not only had the knowledge of pendency of the 32 appeal but also had notice of fixing of hearing of the appeal. Even on 18th September, 2003, the High Court took notice of the cross-objection and counsel for the appellant(s)/cross objector was directed to furnish copies of the cross-objection within three weeks to the Additional Advocate General. After the records from lower courts were received, the matter was heard and judgment impugned in the present appeal was pronounced by the High Court on 22nd October, 2003. 48. In these circumstances, it is difficult for this Court to hold that the period of 30 days, as contemplated under Order XLI Rule 22 of the Code, never commenced even till final disposal of the appeal. Such an interpretation will frustrate the very purpose of the Code and would be contrary to the legislative intent. We may also notice that the appeal was finally heard without fixing any particular date and in presence of the appellant(s). Under such circumstances, the requirement of fixing a final date separately must be deemed to be waived by the parties. 49. It may be noticed that somewhat divergent views have been taken by different High Courts while interpreting the 33 provisions of Order XLI Rule 22 of the Code. The High Court of Rajasthan in the case of The East India Hotels Limited v. Smt. Mahendra Kumari [AIR 2008 Raj. 131] took the view that respondent cross-objector had put in appearance through his counsel as a caveator and the appeal was admitted on 28th March, 2006 in his presence and participation. As the appeal was admitted in their presence, the Rajasthan High Court opined that no notice thereafter was required to be served on the caveator for the purposes of Order XLI Rule 22 and period of limitation of one month would start from 28th March, 2006 (i.e. the date of admission) for filing of cross-objection. The filing of the cross objection in that case was delayed by 507 days. On the issue of condonation the High Court felt that the delay could not be condoned in the facts and circumstances of the case and thus dismissed the cross-objections as barred by time. It also needs to be noticed that the judgments of the Delhi High Court in the case of Jhutter Singh (supra) and Rashida Begum (supra) were also examined by the Rajasthan High Court and are distinguished on facts as in those cases at no point of time the objector or respondent had participated. 34 50. The Rajasthan High Court also relied upon the judgment of the High Court of Andhra Pradesh in the case of Mutyam Agaiah v. Special Deputy Collector, (NTPC) L.A. Unit . [2002 (2) ALT 715] wherein that High Court while accepting the submissions of the respondent had held that: ""...We have to understand the issue of notices in the proper perspective. The notices are meant for giving knowledge to the other side regarding the judicial proceedings filed by the appellant. It is not every time necessary that the notices should be in writing in the prescribed form. If the knowledge of filing of the appeals can be proved, then it is sufficient notice in law. The respondent-cross objector engaged an Advocate, who filed vakalatnama and he defended the cause of the claimant in the Original Petition. It means that the cross-objector had sufficient knowledge regarding the appeals. Nothing prevented for the respondent-cross-objector for filing the objections......."" 51. In the case of Rashida Begum (supra) the Delhi High Court had noticed that limitation for filing the cross objection would start from the date of service of notice of hearing of the appeal. A notice containing only the date of hearing of the stay 35 application but not the appeal would not be `notice' as contemplated under Order XLI Rule 22 of the Code. 52. The view taken by the Delhi High Court is more in line with the intent of the provisions of Order XLI Rule 22 while the decision of the Rajasthan High Court was on its own facts and cannot be treated to be stating a preposition of law. The application of law would always depend upon the facts and circumstances of a given case and what is the true and correct construction of Order XLI Rule 22 we shall shortly proceed to state. 53. In the case of Pralhad & others v. State of Maharashtra and another [2010 (10) SCC 458], a Bench of this Court to which one of us was a member was dealing with the object and scope of the powers vested in the Court in terms of Order XLI Rule 33 of the Code. This Court observed that Rule 33 empowers the Appellate Court to pass any decree or make any order which ought to have been passed or made and also to pass or make such further decree or order as the case may require. The Appellate Court can exercise this power notwithstanding that appeal is only with respect to a part of 36 decree. This power may be exercised in favour of any of the respondents or the parties although such respondent or party may not have filed any appeal or objections. In other words, the Court has been vested with the power to pass such orders which ought to have been passed in the facts of a given case. While dealing with this issue, this Court held as under: ""18. The provision of Order XLI Rule 33 CPC is clearly an enabling provision, whereby the appellate court is empowered to pass any decree or make any order which ought to have been passed or made, and to pass or make such further or other decree or order as the case may require. Therefore, the power is very wide and in this enabling provision, the crucial words are that the appellate court is empowered to pass any order which ought to have been made as the case may require. The expression ""order ought to have been made"" would obviously mean an order which justice of the case requires to be made. This is made clear from the expression used in the said rule by saying ""the court may pass such further or other order as the case may require"". This expression ""case"" would mean the justice of the case. Of course, this power cannot be exercised ignoring a legal interdict or a prohibition clamped by law."" 54. The Court clearly held that the expression ""order ought to have been made"" obviously means an order which justice demands in facts of the case. The dictum of law stated by this 37 Court clearly demonstrates that justice between the parties to a case is the essence of procedural law and unless the statute expressly prohibits or put an embargo, the Courts would interpret the procedural law so as to achieve the ends of justice. 55. If we examine the provisions of Order XLI Rule 22 of the Code in its correct perspective and in light of the above stated principles then the period of limitation of one month stated therein would commence from the service of notice of the day of hearing of appeal on the respondent in that appeal. The hearing contemplated under Order XLI Rule 22 of the Code normally is the final hearing of the appeal but this rule is not without any exception. The exception could be where a party respondent appears at the time of admission of the appeal, as a caveator or otherwise and argues the appeal on merits as well as while passing of interim orders and the Court has admitted the appeal in the presence of that party and directs the appeal to be heard finally on a future date actual or otherwise, then it has to be taken as complete compliance of the provisions of Order XLI Rule 22 of the Code and thereafter, the appellant 38 who has appeared himself or through his pleader cannot claim that period mentioned under the said provision of the Code would commence only when the respondent is served with a fresh notice of hearing of the appeal in the required format. If this argument is accepted it would amount to travesty of justice and inevitably result in delay while causing serious prejudice to the interest of the parties and administration of justice. Such interpretation would run contra to the legislative intent behind the provisions of Order XLI Rule 11 of the Code which explicitly contemplate that an appeal shall be heard expeditiously and disposed of as far as possible within 60 days at the admission stage. All the provisions of Order XLI of the Code have to be read conjunctively to give Order XLI Rule 22 its true and purposive meaning. Having analytically examined the provisions of Order XLI Rule 22, we may now state the principles for its applications as follow: (a) Respondent in an appeal is entitled to receive a notice of hearing of the appeal as contemplated under Order XLI Rule 22 of the Code; 39 (b) The limitation of one month for filing the cross-objection as provided under Order XLI Rule 22 of the Code shall commence from the date of service of notice on him or his pleader of the day fixed for hearing the appeal. (c) Where a respondent in the appeal is a caveator or otherwise puts in appearance himself and argues the appeal on merits including for the purposes of interim order and the appeal is ordered to be heard finally on a date fixed subsequently or otherwise, in presence of the said respondent/caveator, it shall be deemed to be service of notice within the meaning of Order XLI Rule 22. In other words the limitation of one month shall start from that date. 56. Needless to notice that the cross-objections are required to be filed within the period of one month from the date of service of such notice or within such further time as the Appellate Court may see fit to allow depending upon the facts and circumstances of the given case. 57. Since the provisions of Order XLI Rule 22 of the Code itself provide for extension of time, the Courts would normally be inclined to condone the delay in the interest of justice 40 unless and until the cross-objector is unable to furnish a reasonable or sufficient cause for seeking the leave of the Court to file cross-objections beyond the statutory period of one month. 58. Examining the case in hand within the legal framework afore-stated, it has to be held that the case falls squarely within the principles formulated in clause (c). The appellant(s) herein were caveators before the High Court and they were heard not only while passing of interim orders but the appeal itself was admitted in their presence. Further, the Court directed that the records from lower court be called and after receipt of such record the appeal was directed to be listed for final disposal. Thus, the cross-objector not merely had the knowledge of pendency of the appeal and order of the High Court for its final disposal but he actually participated at all the stages of the proceedings before that Court, i.e. at the stage of admission of appeal, passing of interim orders and variation thereof and at the stage of consideration of application of the cross-objector, moved for early hearing of the appeal and, in fact, the appeal had been directed to be heard finally in his 41 presence. Thus, in these circumstances, one month of prescribed period in terms of Order XLI Rule 22 of the Code shall commence from 12th September, 2001, i.e. the date on which the High Court ordered that the appeal may be listed for hearing. 59. As the period for filing the cross objection had long expired, the application for condonation of delay was filed. It is interesting to note that the appellants in this Court themselves admitted that they had received the notice of the appeal through their counsel and the period of one month came to an end on 12th October, 2001. This submission has been made in paragraph 3 of the affidavit annexed to the application filed by the cross-objector before the High Court under Section 5 of the Limitation Act, 1963, along with the cross-objections, praying for condonation of delay and leave of that Court to file their cross-objections beyond the statutory period of one month as provided in Order XLI Rule 22 of the Code. 60. Delay was sought to be condoned on the ground that the appellants have appeared before the Court and despite receipt of the notice of final hearing they could not file cross-objections 42 within the prescribed time as they were out of their native place and have gone to Karwar to earn their livelihood and they could not therefore receive the letter and that too within one month. Later, the appellant fell down and his leg was twisted and because of swelling and pain he was not able to drive and consult his counsel in Bangalore. It is only after he got well, he met his counsel and filed the cross-objections on 19th November, 2002, i.e. after a delay of 404 days. The High Court did not find any merit in the reasons shown for condonation of delay and dismissed the said application. We have already noticed that Order XLI Rule 22 of the Code itself provides a discretion to the Appellate Court to grant further time to the cross-objector for the purposes of filing cross-objections provided the cross-objector shows sufficient or reasonable cause for his inability to file the cross-objections within the stipulated period of one month from the date of receipt of the notice of hearing of appeal. No specific reasons have been recorded by the High Court in the impugned judgment as to why the said averments did not find favour and was disbelieved. There is nothing on record to rebut these 43 averments made by the cross-objector. 61. In the peculiar facts and circumstances of this case, to do complete justice between the parties, we allow the landowner's appeal by setting aside the order of the High Court, limited to the extent that the appellants herein have been able to show sufficient/reasonable cause for grant of further time to file the cross objections beyond the period of one month in terms of Order XLI Rule 22 of the Code. This approach could even be adopted without the aid of Section 5 of the Limitation Act, 1963, which provisions may also find application to such matters. Be that as it may, we do not consider it necessary to delve on this issue in any further detail. Suffice it to say that the appellants were entitled to file cross-objections by grant of further time before the High Court. Delay in filing the cross- objections is thus condoned. 62. The High Court has therefore to hear afresh the appeal of the State as also the cross objections of the landowners. In that view of the matter, there is no need of passing a separate order on the appeal filed by the State before this Court and the same is thus disposed of. 44 63. Since considerable time has elapsed, we request the High Court to dispose of the appeal and the cross objections as early as possible, preferably within a period of three months from the date of production of this order before the High Court. 64. Parties to bear their own costs. ......................................J. (ASOK KUMAR GANGULY) ...................................J. (SWATANTER KUMAR) New Delhi May 10, 2011 45"

Supreme Court of India Apm Terminals B.V vs Union Of India & Anr on 11 May, 2011 Equivalent citations: AIRONLINE 2011 SC 598 Author: Altamas Kabir Bench: Cyriac Joseph , Altamas Kabir REPORTABLE IN THE SUPREME COURT OF INDIA CIVIL APPELLATE JURISDICTION CIVIL APPEAL NO.4270 OF 2011 (Arising out of S.L.P.(C)No.13893 of 2010) APM TERMINALS B.V. ... APPELLANT Vs. UNION OF INDIA & ANR. ... RESPONDENTS WITH T.C.(CIVIL) NOS.36-37 OF 2010 J U D G M E N T ALTAMAS KABIR, J. 1. Leave granted in SLP(C)No.13893 of 2010, which is being heard along with Transferred Case (Civil) 2 Nos.36-37 of 2010. While the appeal has been filed by APM Terminals B.V. against the decision of the High Court, dismissing its writ petition, challenging the decision of the Board of Trustees for the Jawaharlal Nehru Port Trust to exclude the appellant from participating in the tender process for the development of the Fourth Container Terminal at the Bombay Port through public-private partnership, the transfer petitions have been filed by PSA Sical Terminals Ltd. for transfer of Writ Petition Nos.19851 and 19384 of 2010 pending before the Madras High Court, to this Court. As the questions involved in the writ petitions pending before the Madras High Court were the same as those raised in the appeal filed by APM Terminals B.V., we had directed the transfer petitions to be heard along with SLP(C)No.13893 of 2010, out of which the present appeal arises. 3 2. In the appeal, the appellant has challenged the validity and propriety of the decision taken by the Board of Trustees of the Jawaharlal Nehru Port Trust, hereinafter referred to as the ""JNPT"", to exclude the appellant from participating in the tender process for the Fourth Container Terminal under the JNPT, through public-private partnership, and praying for quashing of the said decision with leave to the appellant to participate in the tender process in accordance with the policy indicated in Circular No. PD-12013/2/2005-JNPT dated 26th September, 2007, issued by the Union of India. The further prayer of the appellant was to read the provisions of the said Circular into the Licence Agreement dated 10th August, 2004, executed between the appellant and JNPT, and, consequently, to release the appellant from the restrictions contained in Clause 8.31 of the Licence Agreement and/or to treat the same as not binding on the appellant. Clause 8.31 of the Licence Agreement 4 which was executed by the Board of Trustees, JNPT, in favour of the appellant, provides as follows : ""8.31 The Licensee acknowledges and agrees that it shall forego the right to bid for either directly or indirectly, including being a Management Contractor through any associate company, whether such company is registered in India or any other country, or any company in which the Licensee has a shareholding for the Additional Facilities or existing facilities during the term of this Agreement. The Licensee also agrees that in the event of it or its parent company taking over/acquiring/amalgamating/merging with the licensee or the parent company to whom the Additional Facilities are awarded it shall be obliged to divest its stake in one of the two licenses to a third entity not linked to the Licensee within 6 months from the date of such change in control failing which it shall be deemed to be a Licensee Event of Default. The Licensee also agrees that in the event of it or its parent company being taken over/acquired/amalgamated/merged by another licensee operating container facilities at JNPT it shall be obliged to divest the License to a third entity not linked to the Licensee within 6 months from the date of such change in control failing which it shall be deemed to be a Licensee Event of Default. The Licensee acknowledges, agrees and accepts the above as essence of this Agreement and the Licence granted to the Licensee."" 5 3. Before the High Court, on behalf of the appellant Company, it was claimed that on account of subsequent resolutions adopted by the Board of Trustees of JNPT, which had the effect of altering the policy with regard to entrustment of operational facilities at the port to provide competition and to prevent monopolies, the provisions of Clause 8.31 would have to be reconsidered in the light of the changed circumstances. Before proceeding any further it will be worthwhile to briefly indicate the background in which the present lis has arisen. 4. The Jawaharlal Nehru Port Bulk Terminal was commissioned on 26th May, 1989, and was designed to handle goods imported in bulk, such as fertilizers, fertilizer raw materials and food grains, with the help of mechanized bulk-handling facilities. With the passage of time, the Central Government found it difficult to maintain the Bulk Terminal and 6 decided to convert the Bulk Terminal into a Container Terminal and to remodel the same on a Build, Operate and Transfer (BOT) Basis on licence for a period of 30 years. Since 1996, it has been the policy of the Central Government to permit participation/investment by the private sector in utilizing the assets of the Port, construction and creation of additional assets, lease of equipment, pilotage, cargo handling, etc. In fact, guidelines had been issued from time to time by the Ministry of Surface Transport which was to be followed by the Major Ports for private sector participation. In pursuance of such policy, the Central Government introduced the process of privatization, subject however, to the regulatory role of the JNPT. Within the regulatory frame-work it was made clear that the Port authorities should ensure that private investment did not result in the creation of private monopolies and that private facilities were available to all users on equal and 7 competitive terms. 5. The appellant is a Company incorporated under the laws of the Netherlands. Together with the Container Corporation of India Limited it formed a Joint Venture Company under the name and style of ""Gateway Terminals India Pvt. Ltd."" registered under the Companies Act, 1956 . The said Joint Venture Company, hereinafter referred to as the ""GTI"", was the successful bidder in the Tender floated by JNPT for development of its existing Bulk Terminal into a Container Terminal. Thereafter, in keeping with the guidelines issued by the Central Government in 1996, which were described as mandatory, the JNPT floated a Tender for the development of a new 600 meter Quay Length Container Terminal at Navi Mumbai and Nhava Sheva International Container Terminal, hereinafter referred to as the ""NSICT"", was the successful bidder in respect of the said Tender. The licence 8 granted to NSICT to operate the first Container Terminal at JNPT culminated in a Build, Operate and Transfer Licence Agreement dated 3rd July, 1997 between JNPT and NSICT which was to subsist for a period of 30 years from the date of the agreement. Clause 2.3 of the said Licence Agreement provides as follows : ""The License will not bar the Licensee from participating in any subsequent bids invited by the Licensor for operation of Container Terminal."" 6. Accordingly, NSICT was given liberty to participate in any subsequent bid for operation of the Container Terminal. 7. In 2002, JNPT floated another Tender for the development of the Second Container Terminal at JNPT and invited Requests for Qualification (RFQ) for the construction thereof. In order to prevent monopoly and promote competition, the JNPT subsequently incorporated Clause 1.3 in the Tender 9 documents for the development of the Second Container Terminal, which reads as follows : ""Clause 1.3 : The port is desirous of entrusting the Project of redevelopment of the bulk terminal to a container terminal, on BOT basis, to another licensee other than the existing Private Terminal Operator (Licensee) at JNPT i.e. Nhava Sheva International Container Terminal (NSICT) Limited or their associates, P&O or the associates, interconnected or sister companies or either of them."" 8. The net result was that NSICT was precluded from participating in the Tender for the development of the Second Container Terminal at JNPT, despite the express provisions of Clause 2.3 of the Licence Agreement. 9. The said decision of the JNPT was challenged by NSICT and its affiliate, P&O Australia Ports Pvt. Ltd., by way of Writ Petition No.3083 of 2002 in the Bombay High Court. During the hearing of the said writ petition, the Union of India and JNPT took the stand that the 1996 Policy and the 10 guidelines would prevail over Clause 2.3 of the Licence Agreement between the said Respondents and the NSICT. Upholding the decision of the Respondents to exclude P&O Australia Ports Pvt. Ltd. and NSICT from participating in the bid for the development of the Second Container Terminal, the Bombay High Court dismissed the writ petition by its order dated 28th January, 2003. The said decision of the Bombay High Court was challenged before this Court, which declined to interfere with the order of the Bombay High Court. However, the Petitioner's Joint Venture Company, GTI Pvt. Ltd., was permitted to bid in the Tender for the development of the Second Container Terminal at JNPT. On completion of the bidding process, the work of development of the Second Container Terminal was awarded to GTI for a term of 30 years from the date of the Licence Agreement which also contained Clause 8.31, extracted hereinabove. In fact, before the Bombay High Court, JNPT had taken 11 a stand that Clause 8.31 had been subsequently incorporated in the Licence Agreement in view of the guidelines promulgated in 1996, which were then in force. 10. In the meanwhile, on or about 26th September, 2007, a decision was taken by the Union of India to alter the 1996 policy and a Circular No.PD- 12013/2/2005-JNPT, was issued indicating that the JNPT should proceed to invite global competitive bidding for an independent ""Stand Alone"" Container Terminal to expand the Container towards North of JNPT by 330 meters, which was designated as the Third Container Terminal. It also clarified the eligibility of existing private container terminal operators at JNPT to compete and bid for any project. In the said Circular dated 26th September, 2007, it was, inter alia, indicated as follows : ""In the instant case while JNPT is in the process of undertaking the bidding for the development of the 330 metre extension of 12 container berth towards North of NSICT project as a stand alone project on BOT basis (330 metre extension project) there are two different private BOT operators operating container terminals in JN Port. As a rational and logical consequence of the stand taken earlier it has been decided that the successful bidder of the previous container terminal on BOT basis (Maersk A/S - CONCOR Consortium) and/or their subsidiaries/allied organizations should be excluded from bidding for the 330 metre extension project. This would mean that for the next BOT container terminal in JN Port in future, the successful bidder of the 330 metre extension project would be excluded and so on. It has also been decided that the above convention shall be followed in all Ports in its true spirit with a view to avoid monopoly and promote competition till such time a formal Policy is finalized and notified."" 11. As a result of the above, neither the appellant nor its affiliates and/or subsidiaries/allied organizations were permitted to participate in the bid for the Stand Alone Container Terminal. Thereafter, in the year 2000, the JNPT floated yet another Tender for development of the Third 13 Container Terminal at JNPT, inviting Requests for Qualification for selection of a developer for the development of the said terminal in which it was categorically mentioned as follows: ""JNPT is desirous of entrusting this project to a Licensee other than Maersk A/S-Concor Consortium and/or their subsidiaries/allied organizations including GTIPL."" 12. The explanation given for the insertion of the said clause was to implement the Circular dated 26th September, 2007. GTI's plea to allow it to participate in the bid was rejected. The appellant was, therefore, subsequently barred from participating in the Tender process for the development of the Third Container Terminal at JNPT. NSICT was, however, allowed to participate in the said Tender process for the development of the Third Container Terminal at the JNPT UN, but such Tender has not yet been finalized. 14 13. In the meantime, on 2nd March, 2009, JNPT floated Tender No. PD/N-14th CT/C-60/2009 and issued a global invitation of a Request for Qualification for development of the Fourth Container Terminal at JNPT. The said Tender contained the following clause. ""The successful bidder/consortium members and/or their subsidiaries/allied organiza- tions in the project for the development of a Stand Alone Container Handling Facility with a key length of 330 meters towards North at JNPT was to be excluded from the bidding in respect of Fourth Container Terminal either as a single applicant or as a consortium."" 14. On a plain understanding of the above mentioned clause, neither the appellant nor its associate companies/allied organizations and/or consortium of GTI was precluded from participating in the said Tender for the development of the Fourth Container Terminal and raising its bid therein. The appellant, thereupon, along with its letter dated 5th March, 2009, addressed to the JNPT, forwarded a 15 Demand Draft for Rs.10,000/- towards purchase of the RFQ document for participation in the bidding process for the Fourth Container Terminal. The appellant was provided with a copy of the RFQ documents, wherein, in Clause 2.2.1(e), it was categorically stipulated as follows : ""2.2.1(e) To avoid private monopoly and to promote competition, the successful bidder/consortium members and/or their subsidiaries/allied organization in th project for the ""Development of a stand alone contasiner handling facility with a quay length of 330-m towards North at NJPT"" shall be excluded from the bidding for DEVELOPMENT OF FOURTH CONTAINER TERMINAL either as a single applicant or as a consortium. Further, for the next BOT container terminal in JN Port in future, the successful bidder/consortium members in the DEVELOMENT OF FOURTH CONTAINER TERMINAL Project would be excluded and so on."" 15. Even at this stage, JNPT did not preclude the appellant from participating in the said tender in respect of the Fourth Container Terminal at JNPT. The appellant was, thereafter, invited to 16 participate in the process for grant of licence for the Fourth Container Terminal. However, to the surprise of the appellant, on 29th June, 2009, the appellant was informed that GTI and/or its associates/allied organizations had been disqualified from bidding for the Fourth Container Terminal in view of Clause 8.31 of the Licence Agreement. As indicated hereinbefore, it was after such decision that the appellant, who was worried about the rights and entitlements arising out of the said Circular, filed Writ Petition No.1551 of 2008 before the Bombay High Court on 29th July, 2009. The said Writ Petition was listed before the Bombay High Court on 25th August, 2009, which dismissed the same on 10th March, 2010, relying solely on the provisions of Clause 8.31 of the Licence Agreement, which disqualified the appellant from participating in the Tender process relating to the Third Container Terminal. 17 16. It is the said order of the High Court which has been challenged in this appeal. 17. Appearing for the appellant, Mr. F.S. Nariman, Senior Advocate, submitted that JNPT had awarded NSICT, owned by P&O Ports, the licence for the development of the First Container Terminal at JNPT. Pursuant thereto, JNPT had entered into a Licence Agreement dated 3rd July, 1997, with NSICT, wherein Clause 2.3, which provided that the said licence would not bar the licensee from participating in any subsequent bids invited by the licensor for operation of the container terminal, was incorporated. Mr. Nariman submitted that despite the 1996 Policy, which aimed at preventing monopoly and promoting competition, the Licence Agreement dated 3rd July, 1997, permitted NSICT to participate in the subsequent bids invited by the JNPT for operation of the Container Terminal. 18 18. Mr. Nariman submitted that on 26th September, 2007, the Union of India issued Circular No. PD-12013/2/2005-JNPT to JNPT indicating that it should invite global competitive bidding for an independent, Stand Alone Container Terminal involving a 330 meter extension of container berth towards the North of JNPT. The said Circular clarified that existing private Container Terminal Operators in JNPT would also be entitled to bid for any project but the JNPT was required to ensure that private investment did not result in the creation of private monopoly and that private facilities were available to all users on equal and competitive terms. Paragraph 5 of the 2007 Policy clearly provided that the successful bidder of the previous Container Terminal on BOT basis and/or their subsidiaries/allied organizations, should be excluded from bidding for the 330 meter extension project. The immediate fall-out of the same would mean that for the next BOT Container Terminal in JN 19 Port in future, the successful bidder of the 330 meter extension project would be excluded and so on. What was also emphatically stated in paragraph 6 is that it had also been decided that the aforesaid guideline should be followed in all Ports in its true spirit with a view to avoiding monopoly and promoting competition, till such time a formal policy was finalized and notified. The 2007 Policy, therefore, provided that MAERSK S/T CONCOR Consortium and/or their subsidiary/allied organizations would be excluded from bidding for the Third Container Terminal and the successful bidder of the Third Container Terminal would be excluded from bidding for the next project and so on. Hence, a successful bidder would be ineligible to bid for the next but one subsequent tender after the immediate one awarded to it. 19. Mr. Nariman submitted that in accordance with the guidelines contained in the 2007 Policy, the 20 appellant was specifically barred from participating in the tender process for the development of the Third Container Terminal at JNPT. NSICT who was the successful bidder for the first container was allowed to participate in the tender process for the development of the Third Container Terminal at JNPT, though the said tender is yet to be finalised. 20. Certain problems arose when on 2nd March, 2009, JNPT floated Tender No. PPD/M-1/4TH CT/C-60/2009 and issued a global invitation for Request for Qualification for development of the Fourth Container Terminal at JNPT, which contained a clause to the effect that the successful bidder/consortium members and/or their subsidiaries/allied organizations in the project for the development of a ""Stand Alone Container handling facility with a Quay length of 330 meter towards North at JNPT should be excluded from the 21 bidding for the development of the Fourth Container Terminal either as a single applicant or as a Consortium. 21. Mr. Nariman submitted that the Request for Qualification excludes only the successful bidder for the Third Container Terminal (which is yet to be awarded) from bidding at the tender for the development of the Fourth Container Terminal. Consequently, the appellant and/or its Associate Company/allied organizations and/or consortium of GTI were not precluded from participating in the tender for the development of the Fourth Container Terminal having been precluded from bidding for the ""Stand Alone"" Container Terminal, in accordance with the 2007 Policy. It was at this stage that JNPT wrote to the appellant on 29th June, 2009, indicating that it has been decided not to allow GTI Pvt. Ltd. and/or its 22 associates to participate in the bidding for the Fourth Container Terminal. Mr. Nariman further submitted that inspite of the decision in NSICT's case, wherein the Union of India had relied on the 1996 Policy, it subsequently changed its stand on the strength of the 2007 Policy indicating that having regard to Clause 8.31 of the Agreement the appellant was barred from bidding for the Fourth Container Terminal. 22. It was submitted that the stand of JNPT was clearly wrong, arbitrary and discriminatory. It was further submitted that the apprehension of the JNPT in regard to creation of monopoly was erroneous and unrealistic since monopoly means the power to determine one's own prices. In the case of Ports, the prices for various Port Services are determined by the Tariff Authority for the Major Ports (TAMP) and periodically operators are required to submit 23 their proposed prices to TAMP and cannot charge more than the TAMP approved prices for any of their services. It was urged that without the power to fix one's own price, the question of monopoly did not arise. 23. Mr. Nariman submitted that the problem has arisen on account of the fact that the tender for the Third Container Terminal is yet to be finalised, and, in the meantime the tender for the Fourth Container Terminal was floated. Consequently, the Fourth tender was treated by the concerned Respondents to be the tender for the Third Container Terminal which meant that the appellant Company stood disqualified from participating in the said tender also, since under the 2007 Policy it could only participate in the next but one subsequent tender after the one awarded to it, thereby suffering double prejudice on account of no fault on its part. Mr. Nariman 24 submitted that to debar the appellant Company from participating in both the Third as well as the Fourth Container Terminals was not justified and it should be allowed to participate in the Fourth tender in accordance with Clause 2.3 of its Licence Agreement. Furthermore, if the stand taken on behalf of the Respondent was to be accepted, despite the supersession of the 1996 Policy by the 2007 Policy, the appellant would also be barred from participating in future tenders for 30 years by virtue of Clause 8.31 of the Licence Agreement, which would only have the effect of reducing the extent of competition which is, in fact, the object of the 2007 Policy of the Union of India. 24. Mr. Nariman also contended that Clause 8.31 of the Licence Agreement had been imposed upon the appellant based on the principles of public policy and keeping in mind the then prevailing Policy of the Government of India, i.e., the 1996 Policy and 25 not out of the free will of the parties. In any event, Clause 8.31 of the Licence Agreement would have to be read with the 2007 Policy and could not be read in isolation. 25. Mr. Nariman urged that when the tender for the Second Container Terminal was floated by the Respondent No.2, it relied heavily on the 1996 Policy to prevent NSICT from bidding at the said tender. When NSICT challenged the said decision by filing a writ petition in the Bombay High Court, the Respondents successfully urged before the Court in the said Writ Petition that the 1996 Policy would prevail over Clause 2.3 of the NSICT contract. On the other hand, as stated hereinbefore, in Writ Petition No.1551 of 2009 filed by the appellant, the Respondents took a contrary stand by contending that Clause 8.31 of the Licence Agreement would prevail over the 2007 Policy. 26 26. Mr. Nariman lastly contended that by allowing the appellant to raise the technical bid and to participate in the pre-bid meeting for the development of the Fourth Container Terminal, the Respondents had given the appellant cause for legitimate expectation of being eligible to bid for and be awarded the contract. Mr. Nariman submitted that the Respondents had acted in a manner engineered to preclude the appellant from participating in the tender for the development of the Fourth Container Terminal at JNPT. 27. Appearing for the Petitioner, PSA Sical Terminals Ltd., in Transferred Case Nos.36-37 of 2010, learned Senior Counsel, Ms. Nalini Chidambaram urged that, although, there was a good deal of similarity in the issues raised in the Special Leave Petition filed by APM Terminals B.V. and the Transferred Cases filed by PSA Sical Terminals Ltd., the substantial question in the 27 Transferred cases was whether a contractual right could be superseded by a general policy decision under Section 111 of the Major Port Trusts Act, 1963, without any legislation. In other words, in the facts of this case, could the Petitioner with whom a Licence Agreement had been signed on 15th July, 1998, by the Respondent No.2, Tuticorin Port Trust, with the previous sanction of the Central Government under Section 42(3) of the Major Port Trusts Act, 1963, be prevented from participating in the tender for additional facilities in the Tuticorin Port, by virtue of a policy decision taken in the teeth of the provisions of the Licence Agreement which vested the Licensee with the right to participate in future tenders. 28. Ms. Chidambaram urged that after the policy of liberalization adopted by the Central Government, the Port Trusts permitted private operators to operate Container Terminals on a Build, Operate and 28 Transfer basis, through a process of tender. PSA Sical participated in the Tender invited by the Tuticorin Port Trust in 1997 for operating the Seventh Berth at Tuticorin, which was the First Container Terminal and was granted licence to operate the said Berth for 30 years. During the subsistence of the guidelines issued by the Government of India on 28th October, 1996, the Tuticorin Port Trust entered into a Licence Agreement with the Petitioner on 15th July, 1998, to operate the Seventh berth and specifically granting a right to the Petitioner to participate in any subsequent bids invited by the said Trust for operation of additional facilities in the same port under Clauses 2.3 and 6.2.3 of the Licence Agreement. For the sake of convenience, the said two clauses in the Licence Agreement are reproduced hereinbelow : ""2.3 License Period 29 The Licence Period shall be for the period of 30 years (including the time taken for the erection of container handling equipments at the Container Terminal) commencing from the Date of Award of License. The license will not bar the licensee from participating in any subsequent bids invited by the licensor for development, designing, engineering, constructing, equipping, maintaining and operating any berth or related facility at the port"". ""6.2.3 The Licensor agrees that it shall not commission additional berths for handling containers until the traffic potential does not appear to exceed 90% of the maximum volume 1, 25,000 TEUs. Provided however that the Licensor shall always consider future expansions of the container berths to reasonably match the market demands and allow the Licensee to participate in its operation without any discrimination. This condition shall be applicable only within the port limits of the Licensor as notified under Indian Ports Act, 1908 and Major Port Trusts Act, 1963 ."" 29. Ms. Chidambaram submitted that it would, therefore, be evident from the above clauses that notwithstanding the 1996 guidelines, while 30 executing the Licence Agreement, the Tuticorin Port Trust consciously granted the Petitioner a specific right to bid in Tenders for future development in the same port and did not consider that the same would result in the creation of a private monopoly. 30. It was submitted that at about the same time, the issue relating to the disqualification of Nhava Sheva International Container Terminal (NSICT), which was operating the Container Terminal at the JNPT and its Associate or interconnected or sister companies, including P&O Ports, from participating in the bid for the re-development of the Bulk Terminal into a Container Terminal at JNPT was taken up for consideration by the Bombay High Court. In the said matter, the JNPT took the stand that since P&O Ports was controlling 48% of the Container traffic in India and was operating the existing private Container Terminals at Jawaharlal Nehru Port Trust and Chennai, a policy 31 decision had been taken by the Port Trusts of the JNPT to debar an existing operator from bidding for the next Container Terminal with the object of avoiding concentration of control in one party and to increase competition and efficiency in the public interest. The said proposal was forwarded to the Central Government which approved the same vide its letter dated 11th November, 2002. 31. Ms. Chidambaram submitted that since P&O Ports and its associates were controlling 48% of the Container business in India, the Bombay High Court upheld the policy of the Central Government aimed at preventing monopolisation of the container business in India by a private party. Ms. Chidambaram submitted that the appeal filed by P&O Ports before this Court was also dismissed, with this Court upholding the comprehensive guidelines that were issued by the Government of India, Ministry of Surface Transport on 26th October, 1996. 32 Ms. Chidambaram, however, urged that the P&O Ports' case was decided on facts which were specific to P&O Ports and could not, therefore, be treated as a precedent for the Petitioner's case. However, the question as to whether a policy decision could supersede the contractual right was not considered by the Bombay High Court or by this Court. 32. Ms. Chidambaram submitted that on 31st May, 2005, the Tuticorin Port Trust invited Tenders for development of Berth No.8 into a Container Terminal and permitted the Petitioner to participate in the tender process. The tender process remained incomplete for over four years and in 2007 a draft policy was formulated to promote inter port and intra port competition in which it was stipulated as follows :- ""Wherever the second terminal is to be set up at the same major port, or first terminal in an adjacent major port e.g. JN Port and Mumbai, Chennai and Ennore Ports, the existing terminal operator would be 33 excluded to ensure competition. If there are a minimum of two private operators in any major port, no restriction would be placed on the existing operators to bid for the subsequent terminal, subject to the condition that a single private operator will not be allowed to operate more than two terminals at the same Major Port including terminals at adjacent major port."" 33. Further to the aforesaid approved policy, the Government of India wrote to the Tuticorin Port Trust that it had been decided to debar the existing operator, the Petitioner herein, who was operating the first Private Terminal, from the bidding process for the second Container Terminal at Tuticorin Port in line with the aforesaid policy decision. The Petitioner was, therefore, denied permission from further participation in the tender for the 8th Berth on account of the aforesaid policy, notwithstanding the specific provision in the Licence Agreement permitting the Petitioner to participate in subsequent Tenders. 34 34. The Petitioner challenged the aforesaid decision denying permission to the Petitioner from participating in the bid for the 8th Berth in Writ Petition No.9746 of 2009. The learned Single Judge dismissed the Writ Petition relying on the decision in the P&O Ports case. In the Writ Appeal No.996 of 2009 filed by the Petitioner against the decision of the learned Single Judge of the Madras High Court, it was submitted on behalf of the Union of India that the need for having a second Private Container Terminal had been reassessed and that it had been decided to scrap the project at the RFP stage itself. The Petitioner's writ appeal was, therefore, dismissed as infructuous. 35. Subsequently, the Union of India issued a new policy guideline under Section 111 of the Major Port Trusts Act, 1963, on 2nd August, 2010, and immediately thereafter on 4th August, 2010, the Tuticorin Port Trust floated re-tender for the 8th 35 Berth and restrained the Petitioner from participating therein in keeping with the new policy guidelines. Ms. Chidambaram submitted that the 2010 Policy provided that if there was one private Container/Berth Operator in a Port for a specific cargo, the Operator of that Berth or his Associates would not be allowed to bid for the next Terminal/Berth for handling the same cargo in the same Port. Ms. Chidambaram submitted that the Petitioner was informed of the said decision of the Tuticorin Port Trust by its letter dated 21st August, 2010. 36. Aggrieved by the aforesaid decision to debar the Petitioner from participating in the bidding process for the 8th Berth/Container Terminal, the Petitioner filed Writ Petition Nos.19384 of 2010 and 19851 of 2010, inter alia, for a direction upon the Respondents to permit the Petitioner to participate in the bid process for the development 36 of the 8th Berth at Tuticorin Port as a Container Terminal and for a further direction upon the authorities of the Tuticorin Port Trust to provide the Request for Qualification documents and to quash the decision not to provide the same. 37. In the background of the aforesaid facts, Ms. Chidambaram contended that a right given to a contractor could be nullified only by a legislation specifically indicating that the agreement stood nullified and not by a general policy decision. Ms. Chidambaram submitted that while the 1996 Policy categorically indicated that the Port should ensure that private investment did not result in the creation of private monopolies, in the Licence Agreement with the petitioner Clauses 2.3 and 6.2.3 were included giving the Petitioner a right to participate in the bid for additional Container Terminals in the same Port. 37 38. Ms. Chidambaram submitted that a draft Policy was prepared by the Central Government on 10th February, 2005, to promote inter port and intra port competition, but the said Policy was never notified and remained a draft. However, based on the draft Policy, the Tuticorin Port Trust invited tenders for the 8th Berth/Container Terminal at Tuticorin and allowed the Petitioner to participate in the tender process for about 3 years until it suddenly took a unilateral decision to debar the Petitioner from the bidding process on the strength of a communication received from the Deputy Secretary, Ministry of Shipping, dated 22nd May, 2009. Ms. Chidambaram submitted that in between the aforesaid decision by which the Petitioner was debarred from participating in the bidding for the 8th Berth/Container Terminal at Tuticorin, the Vizag Port on 5th June, 2008, took a decision to shortlist the existing BOT Operators while recording that the same should not be taken as a precedent. 38 39. Ms. Chidambaram submitted that it was unreasonable on the part of the Respondents to debar the Petitioner from participating in the 8th Berth/Container Terminal without formalising a formal policy with regard to the intention of promoting competition and avoiding monopoly. It was also urged that P&O Ports, which had earlier been debarred from participating in the bidding for the Second Container Terminal at the JNPT, was allowed to participate in the bid for the Third Container Terminal, although the P&O Ports and its Associates were controlling 48% of the Container Terminal business in India and by allowing it to participate in the Third Tender, the Central Government was, in fact, going back on its desire to eliminate monopoly by private Operators within the Indian Ports. 40. Ms. Chidambaram urged that it would be apparent from the changing policies adopted by the Central 39 Government that they were made to suit a particular situation and possibly a particular tenderer. It was submitted that even though the First Respondent was entitled to change its policies from time to time, such changes had to be informed by reason, which was absent in the instant case. Ms. Chidambaram added that the decision in the P&O Ports' case could not be taken to be a precedent as far as the Petitioner, PSA Sical Terminals Ltd., was concerned, since P&O Ports was not a party to the Licence Agreement at JNP and had no contractual right to bid for the Second Container Terminal there. Although, NSICT had such a right in view of Clause 2.3 of its Licence Agreement to bid for Container Terminal No.7, it did not assert its right and the same was not also considered in the judgment delivered by the High Court. 41. In support of her submissions, Ms. Chidambaram first referred to the decision of this Court in 40 Delhi Cloth & General Mills Ltd. Vs. Rajasthan State Electricity Board [(1986) 2 SCC 431], wherein the High Court had quashed the decision of the Rajasthan Electricity Board to charge uniform tariff despite the prevailing concessional rates granted to a consumer under an agreement, upon holding that only a legislative amendment could override a contractual right by specifically overriding the contractual terms. Ms. Chidambaram also referred to the decision of this Court in PTC India Ltd. Vs. Central Electricity Regulatory Commission [(2010) 4 SCC 603], wherein, in the context of determination of tariff under the Electricity Act, 2003 , this Court held that the making of a Regulation under Section 178 of the Act became necessary because a Regulation made under Section 178 had the effect of interfering with and overriding the existing contractual relationship between the regulated entities. This Court held that a Regulation under Section 178 is in the 41 nature of subordinate legislation which could even override the existing contracts, including Power Purchase Agreements, which had to be aligned with a Regulation under Section 178 and could not have been done only on the basis of an order of the Central Commission. 42. Ms. Chidambaram reiterated that while the Central Government was entitled to alter its policies regarding participation of candidates in the bid process for the Second Container Terminal at the Tuticorin Port, such alteration would have to be informed by reason and not on the whims of the authorities, which is so apparent in the facts of the present case. Accordingly, in the absence of a formal policy regarding the participation of candidates in the bid process for the Second Container Terminal of the Tuticorin Port Trust and, in particular, the Petitioner, which was covered by Clause 2.3 of the Licence Agreement, the Petitioner 42 could not have been barred from participating in the tender process for being awarded the contract for the Second Container Terminal at Tuticorin Port. Ms. Chidambaram submitted that the decision of the Tuticorin Port Trust Authorities to debar the Petitioner from participating in the tender process suffered from the view of Wadnesbury unreasonableness and was liable to be quashed. 43. The learned Solicitor General, Mr. Gopal Subramaniam, appearing for the Union of India in both the matters, submitted that the case of the appellant, APM Terminals B.V., and that of the Petitioner, PSA Sical Terminals Ltd., stand on a similar footing, despite Ms. Chidambaram's efforts to prove otherwise. The learned Solicitor General submitted that the same policy decisions taken by the Central Government in regard to private participation in the development and operation of Container Terminals in the Major Indian Ports 43 governed both the cases, though at different ports. The learned Solicitor General submitted that on 26th October, 1996, the Union of India issued guidelines for all Major Port Trusts regarding private sector participation in the major ports. In the preamble of the said guidelines it was indicated that in order to improve efficiency, productivity and quality of service, as well as to bring in competitiveness in port service, it had been decided to throw open the port sector to private sector participation. It was, however, made clear in Clause 4 of the policy statement that ports would have to ensure that private investment did not result in the creation of private monopolies and that private facilities were available to all users on equal and competitive terms. 44. Pursuant to the said policy decision, the JNPT decided to convert the Bulk Terminal which had been commissioned on 26th May, 1989, and had been 44 designed to handle imported fertilizers, fertilizer raw materials and food grains through mechanized bulk handling facilities, into a Container Terminal on Build, Operate and Transfer (BOT) basis on licence for a period of 30 years. Tenders were invited and, ultimately, NSICT proved successful and was granted such licence by the JNPT for the First Container Terminal. The learned Solicitor General submitted that at the said point of time, Clause 2.3 was included in the Licence Agreement which provided that the Licence Agreement to NSICT would not prevent it from participating in any subsequent bid invited by JNPT for operation of Container Terminals. However, in order to give effect to its policy decision to prevent private monopolisation, the JNPT floated another Tender on 28th October, 2002, for construction of a Second Container Terminal in which Clause 1.3 of the Tender documents provided that JNPT was desirous of entrusting the project to another Licensee other 45 than the existing Licensee at JNPT or its associates and interconnected or sister companies. The learned Solicitor General submitted that in the said process, GTI, a Joint Venture Company of APM Terminals and CONCOR proved to be the successful bidder. 45. Mr. Subramaniam also indicated that Clause 1.3, referred to hereinabove, was challenged by NSICT in Writ Petition No.3083 of 2002, before the Bombay High Court which dismissed the same and upheld the decision to exclude NSICT. The said decision of the Bombay High Court was also upheld by this Court. 46. The learned Solicitor General submitted that in the agreement entered into with GTI it was specifically mentioned in Clause 8.3 that the Licensee would forego the right to bid for, either directly or indirectly, the additional facilities or existing facilities, during the term of the 46 agreement. It was submitted that certain other conditions were also stipulated in the said clause which were aimed at preventing private monopolisation of the facilities of the port. 47. The learned Solicitor General submitted that in keeping with its aforesaid policy decision, while allowing the JNPT to invite Global Tenders for a ""Stand Alone"" project, the Central Government reminded JNPT of the Government policy formulated in October, 1996, to ensure that private investment did not create private monopolies. It was also clarified that the policy adopted to exclude the existing container operator from the tender for the next container, would continue till such time a formal policy was finalised and notified. It was submitted that in the light of such decision, a Global invitation was issued by JNPT on 2nd March, 2009, for development of the Fourth Container Terminal at JNPT, and those who had been permitted 47 to participate for the Third Container Berths were excluded. The learned Solicitor General submitted that it was only a question of fortuitous circumstances which resulted in the tender for the Third Container Terminal remaining unfinalised. Since GTI had been granted licence for the Second Container Terminal, it was only in keeping with the policy decision of the Respondents that the appellant, APM Terminals B.V., was barred from participating in the Tender for the Third Container Terminal and was allowed to participate in the bid for the Fourth Container Terminal. If the Tender process for the Third Container Terminal had been concluded, the present situation would not have arisen. It is only because of the fact that the Tender for the Third Container Terminal could not be concluded that the Tender for the Fourth Container Terminal was treated to be the Tender for the Third Container Terminal and as a result, the appellant stood disqualified. 48 48. The learned Solicitor General submitted that the Central Government was only following its decision to ensure healthy competition and to prevent the concentration of control of the Major Port Trusts in the hands of the private sector which could result in unintended discrimination, since the private operators had been given the right to give priority berthing to their own ships and other ships could be serviced on a `First come First served' basis. 49. Countering the submissions made by Mr. Nariman and Ms. Chidambaram regarding the doctrine of legitimate expectation and the right of the Government to alter its policy, the learned Solicitor General referred to the decision of this Court in Punjab Communications Ltd. Vs. Union of India & Ors. [(1999) 4 SCC 727], wherein, it was held that a change in policy could defeat a substantive legitimate expectation if it could be 49 justified on Wednesbury reasonableness. The learned Solicitor General, therefore, submitted that the decision taken by the Government to prevent private monopoly in the handling of port activities was fully justified and could have an overriding effect over contractual terms arrived at by the Government with a private party. 50. On behalf of the JNPT, it was submitted by Mr. Vikas Singh, learned Senior Advocate, that the challenge thrown to the order passed by the Bombay High Court, upholding the decision of JNPT to exclude the appellant from participating in any Tender for development of the port facilities for a period of 30 years from the date of signing of the agreement, was fully justified. Mr. Vikas Singh submitted that in view of Clause 8.3.1 of the Agreement entered into between JNPT and the appellant, it was not open to the appellant to resile from the same. Furthermore, global tenders 50 had been invited for the construction of the Fourth Container facility on 2nd March, 2009 and as per the said agreement, the appellant remained ineligible to participate in the said Tender also. Mr. Vikas Singh submitted that it is no doubt true that originally the appellant was provided with RFQ documents, but subsequently it was informed that in view of Clause 8.3.1 in its Agreement dated 10th August, 2004, it was not entitled to participate in the tender process for the Fourth Container facility. 51. While adopting the submissions made by the learned Solicitor General, Mr. Vikas Singh also submitted that since the Tender for the Third Container facility had not been proceeded with, the Tender for the Fourth Container Terminal would be treated to be the Tender for the Third Container Terminal from which the appellant and its 51 associates stood excluded on account of the existing policy dated 26th September, 2007. 52. Mr. Vikas Singh submitted that while deciding the Writ Petition filed by NSICT, neither the Bombay High Court nor this Court had the benefit of the subsequent Constitution Bench decision of this Court in PTC India Limited Vs. Central Electricity Regulatory Commission [(2010) 4 SCC 603], in which this court had held that ""regulatory intervention into the existing contracts across-the-board could have been done only by making Regulations under Section 178 and not by passing an Order under Section 79(1)(j) of the 2003 Act"". Mr. Vikas Singh submitted that the appeal filed by APM Terminals B.V. was without merit and was liable to be dismissed. 53. We have carefully considered the submissions made on behalf of the respective parties and are ad idem with the learned Solicitor General that the 52 appeals and the Transferred Cases raise the same issue and the only difference between the two is that the appellant had not referred to or sought the benefit of Clause 2.3 of its agreement, which permitted it to participate in future tenders in relation to development work within the port area, while in the petitioner's case the same formed the main plank of its claim. In substance, the question that we are faced with is whether despite the contractual right vested in the appellant as well as in the petitioner in the Transferred cases to participate in future tender processes for developmental work within the port area, such right could be taken away and/or curtailed by a unilateral policy decision of the Central Government. The further question in the case of the appellant is whether having been debarred from participating in the bid for the Third Container Terminal in JNPT, it could also be excluded from the bidding process of the Fourth Container 53 Terminal. 54. Both the Bombay High Court as well as this Court have held that in public interest it was open to the Government to alter its policies in order to subserve the common good and that contractual rights would have to give way to the greater public interest, which in this case was to prevent the creation of private monopolies in the management of port facilities in the Major Ports in the country, as this could have far-reaching and disastrous consequences as far as shipping in such ports was concerned. As already indicated hereinabove, the policy decision of 26th October, 1996, made provision for privatisation and also gave private operators the right to give priority berthing to their own ships. The said decision had the potential of substantially disrupting the schedule of other ships intending to use the port facilities and could discourage foreign ships from coming to 54 Indian Ports and thereby disturb the very pattern of the shipping trade in India. 55. While disposing of Writ Petition No.8083 of 2002, filed by P&O Australia Ports Pty. Limited against the Board of Trustees of JNPT, the Division Bench of the Bombay High Court examined the question raised herein at length. It found that the appellants were handling container terminals in Karachi and Sri Lanka and also at JNP and Chennai, thereby exercising control over 48% of the container traffic in India. The High Court held that the two existing terminals at JNP and Chennai are the biggest container terminals in the country and if the appellant and the petitioner in the Transferred Cases were permitted to operate the new container terminals also, they would have virtual monopoly of the container traffic in the entire country which would not be in the public interest. 55 56. The High Court also took note of the fact that certain shipping agents and their associates had expressed concern regarding the increased tariff charged by the appellant at its container terminals at JNP and the possibility of a monopoly being created by it in the country. The High Court took note of the fact that port authorities all over the world had woken up to the possibility of private monopolies controlling the use of port facilities in such a manner so as to benefit their own ships to the detriment of world-wide shipping as a whole. The High Court took note of the fact that P&O Ports itself had been excluded from bidding for the Third Container Terminal in the Port of Melbourne on the ground that it would give the said operator a position of dominance which was to be avoided in the interest of the shipping industry at large. Two other examples of Port Klang in Malaysia and Bhabange Port in Thailand, were also taken note of by the Bombay High Court where different 56 independent operators were appointed to promote competition. 57. It is precisely for such reason that it had become necessary for the Central Government to alter its policy decision regarding entrusting control of the container terminals in the major ports of India in a manner so as to eliminate monopolisation and to encourage competition. The decision of the High Court was duly endorsed by this Court in SLP(C)No.7488 of 2003 and it was observed that the High Court had rightly dismissed the writ petition. 58. Insofar as the decision taken by the Central Government to alter its policy regarding the grant of licence for operating the container terminals in the Major Ports in India as against the contractual right embodied in the form of Clause 2.3 in the agreements executed or entered into between the Central Government and the appellant and the 57 petitioner in the Transferred Cases, is concerned, the said controversy is no longer valid in regard to the appellant, since such point had not been taken on its behalf in the writ petition before the Bombay High Court. However, the same has been taken as a specific point on behalf of the petitioner in the Transferred Cases as far as the Tenders for the Second Container Terminal at the Tuticorin Port are concerned. The said question has to be considered in the light of Article 14 of the Constitution and the greater public interest as against the contractual right of the individual. 59. The provisions of Clause 2.3 in the Agreements signed between the Tuticorin Port Trust and PSA Sical cannot be read in isolation of the other provisions in the agreement which prevented the Licensee from bidding for other work within the port area during the period of the licence. In fact, in our view, the change in policy to prevent 58 private mobilization has been held to be justified by the Bombay High Court as well as this Court. In the absence of any arbitrariness in effecting such change in policy and keeping in mind the larger public interest, we are of the view, that the Central Government was within its powers to strike a balance with regard to the control of the port facilities so that the same did not come to be concentrated in the hands of one private group or consortium which would be in a dominant position to control not only the rights of tariff, but also the entry of ships, not belonging to such group, into the Major Ports and thereby give an undue advantage to its own ships over other shipping agencies. 60. Normally, the Courts do not interfere with policy decisions of the Government unless they are arbitrary or offend any of the provisions of the Constitution. In the present cases, the adoption of such a course would, in our view, be apposite. 59 61. It has been the consistent view of this Court that a change in policy by the Government can have an overriding effect over private treaties between the Government and a private party, if the same was in the general public interest and provided such change in policy was guided by reason. Several decisions have been cited by the parties in this regard in the context of preventing private manopolisation of port activities to an extent where such private player would assume a dominant position which would enable them to control not only the berthing of ships but the tariff for use of the port facilities. In both the cases under consideration, the same set of entrepreneurs are interested in gaining control over the different container terminals to the exclusion of other players. The Central Government in its Ministry of Shipping and Transport, therefore, took a decision not to permit licensees who have been granted a licence for running one of the container terminal 60 berths from participating in the bid process for the immediate next container terminal, with the intention of promoting healthy competition for the benefit of the shipping industry and the ports in India as well. The decision to alter its policy is based on sound reasoning and the Central Government has taken such decision for the benefit of the consumers as a whole. The changed policy would also have the effect of preventing cartelisation and dominant status, which could inevitably affect the ultimate pricing of consumer goods within the country. As was held in Shimnit Utsch India Private Ltd. Vs. West Bengal Transport Infrastructure Development Corporation Limited and Ors. [(2010) 6 SCC 303], the Government was entitled to change its policies with changing circumstances and only on grounds of change a policy does not stand vitiated. 61 62. It was further held that Government has the discretion to adopt a different policy, alter or change its policy to make it more effective. The only qualifying condition is that such change in policy must be free from arbitrariness, irrationality, bias and malice and must be in conformity with the principle of Wednesbury reasonableness. Although, it has been urged by Ms. Chidambaram that such change in policy could be effected only by way of legislation, such a submission, if accepted, could stultify the powers of the Central Government to alter its policies with changing circumstances for the benefit of the public at large. It is not as if the right of a licensee to bid for a further container terminal berth has been excluded for the entire period of the Licence Agreement but in order to ensure proper competition and participation by all intending tenderers, the said policy has also been altered to 62 enable such licensees to bid for the next but one tender as and when invited. 63. However, as far as the appellant is concerned, it is because of certain fortuitous circumstances that it came to be excluded from the tender process for the Fourth Container Terminal. If the tender process for the Third Container Terminal had been concluded, the various complications could have been avoided since under the revised policy, the appellant was entitled to participate in the alternate bids. The appellant having been excluded from one bid on the basis of an existing policy, cannot be debarred from participating in the next bid, by taking recourse to a different yardstick. Such a course of action would be contrary to public policy. Accordingly, the authorities of the JNPT shall allow the appellant to continue to participate in the tender process for the Fourth Container Terminal and the decision to the contrary 63 conveyed to the appellant on 29th June, 2009, is quashed. 64. As far as PSA Sical Terminals Ltd. is concerned, Ms. Chidambaram's submission as to the applicability of the doctrine of legitimate expectation is at best an expectation if there are cogent grounds to deny the same. The said doctrine has been explained by this Court in Sethi Auto Service Station Vs. Delhi Development Authority [(2009) 1 SCC 180], and it was held that the appellant in the said case had certain expectations which were duly considered and favourable recommendations had also been made, but the final decision-making authority considered the matter when the policy had undergone a change and the cases of the appellants therein did not meet the new criteria for allotment laid down in the new policy. It was also observed that the concept of legitimate expectation has no role to play where 64 State action is based on public policy and in the public interest, unless the action taken amounted to an abuse of power. 65. As we have indicated earlier, the Central Government was within its powers to adopt a policy to prevent the port facilities from being concentrated in the hands of one private group or consortium which could have complete control over the use of the facilities of the ports to the detriment of the shipping industry as a whole. The decision taken by the Tuticorin Port Trust Authorities to exclude PSA Sical Terminals Ltd. from bidding for the 8th Berth Container Terminal cannot, therefore, be said to be arbitrary or unreasonable so as to warrant interference. In fact, the position of PSA Sical Terminals Ltd. is no different from that of A.P.M. Terminals B.V. which had been excluded from the bid for the Third Container Terminal at JNPT. 65 66. In the aforesaid circumstances, the appeal filed by APM Terminals BV is allowed and the decision of the Bombay High Court is set aside. However, we are also of the view that the decision of the Madras High Court does not call for any interference and the Transfer Cases filed by PSA Sical Terminals Limited are accordingly dismissed, but without any order as to costs. 66. All interim orders are vacated. ......................................................J. (ALTAMAS KABIR) ......................................................J.

Dattu Bench: H. L. Dattu , D.K. Jain REPORTABLE IN THE SUPREME COURT OF INDIA CIVIL APPELLATE JURISDICTION CIVIL APPEAL NO. 4099 OF 2000 Shankara Co-op Housing Society Ltd. .............. Appellant versus M. Prabhakar & Ors. ..............Respondents WITH CIVIL APPEAL NO. 4100 OF 2000, 4101 of 2000 AND CIVIL APPEAL NO. .......... OF 2011 (Arising out of SPECIAL LEAVE PETITION (C) NO. 6964 of 2001) J U D G M E N T H.L. Dattu, J. 1) We grant leave in the special leave petition filed by the State of Andhra Pradesh. 1 2) In these civil appeals, we are required to consider essentially the erstwhile legislations with regard to the administration of property left behind in India by evacuees migrated to Pakistan during partition and the compensatory redistribution of the same amongst those persons who had migrated from Pakistan, leaving behind their property, at the time of partition. 3) The subject matter are the lands in Survey Nos. 9, 11, 47, 140, 141, 142, 143, 151, 152, 153, 676 and 677, admeasuring about 90.08 acres, situated at Khapra Village, in the erstwhile Medchal Taluk (now Vallabhnagar Taluk) of the Ranga Reddy District, Andhra Pradesh [hereinafter referred to as `the disputed lands']. 4) In this batch of three civil appeals, the appellant is the subsequent purchaser of the property in dispute from the allottees under the provisions of The Displaced Persons (Compensation and Rehabilitation) Act, 1954 (hereinafter referred to as, ""the Displaced Persons Act""). It assails the judgment and order of the Division Bench of the High Court of Andhra Pradesh in WP No. 17722 of 1990 dated 27.04.2000. The State Government has also filed Special Leave Petition (c) No. 6964 of 2001 under Article 136 of the Constitution, in 2 defense of the notification which was struck down by the impugned judgment. Since the facts and questions of law raised before us are the same in all these civil appeals, we will take up C.A. No. 4099 of 2000, in the case of Shankara Co-op. Housing Society Ltd. as the lead case for the purpose of narrating the facts leading upto the impugned judgement. 5) The facts in extenso require to be noticed. They are:- The disputed lands originally belonged to one Mandal Bucham, whose legal representatives are respondents herein. Shri Mandal Bucham had borrowed paper currency from late Rahim Baksh Khan and since he failed to discharge the amount due, late Rahim Baksh Khan had filed a civil suit against Mandal Bucham before the District and Sessions Judge at Hyderabad District. It appears that the Court had passed a judgment and decree in favour of late Rahim Baksh Khan. In the execution proceedings of the decree, it is alleged that late Rahim Baksh Khan had purchased the disputed lands belonging to Mandal Bucham in an auction under the supervision of the Court. Rahim Baksh Khan expired in the year 1940 and later on, it appears, his legal representatives had migrated to Pakistan after partition of India. 3 6) It is averred that the Deputy Custodian and Collector, Hyderabad District, had issued notice dated 11.01.1951, to the legal heirs of late Rahim Baksh Khan, namely Mr. Rafi Mohammed Khan and Mr. Shafi Mohammed Khan, under sub-Section (1) of Section 7 of the Administration of Evacuee Property Act, 1950 [hereinafter referred to as ""the Evacuee Property Act ""] inter alia stating that the ""disputed lands"" belonged to late Rahim Baksh Khan and they have migrated to Pakistan and they are evacuee and, therefore, he would hold an enquiry in the matter on 27.01.1951 and any person having any share or interest in the above ""disputed lands"" are directed to participate in the proceedings with necessary documents in support of their claim. It appears that general notices were also published in the village in which the said lands were situated on 26.01.1951. Notice was also given to the ancestors of the contesting respondents on 15.02.1951. It is stated that neither the contesting respondents nor anybody else had filed any objection to the notice issued under Section 7(1) of the Evacuee Property Act. 7) After conducting a detailed enquiry in respect to the claim of ownership of the said property, the Deputy Custodian and Collector issued a Notification No.55, in NO CE/4064 to 4080 dated 4 11.12.1952, declaring the disputed property in issue as an Evacuee Property under Section 7 of the Evacuee Property Act. This notification was subsequently published in the Hyderabad Government Gazette. Pursuant to the aforesaid declaration, the name of the Collector/Custodian was entered in the Revenue Records. After such declaration, the Central Government has acquired the ""disputed lands"" by issuing notification under Section 12 of the Displaced Persons Act for the rehabilitation of the persons who were displaced during the partition. 8) The erstwhile owners of the property or the ancestors of the contesting respondents did not question the declaration of the ""disputed lands"" as evacuee property and the subsequent acquisition by the Central Government. It was on or about in the year 1955, the ancestors of the respondents herein claimed ownership of the `disputed lands' and made their representation before the authorities under the Evacuee Property Act . The authorities, however, had informed them that they should prefer an appeal or a review petition. In spite of such counsel, they continued to make representations and petitions in furtherance of their claim. 5 9) The Tahsildar, Medchal Taluk, issued a letter dated 29.06.1966, inter- alia, seeking to auction the ""disputed lands"" on yearly lease basis. Aggrieved by the action of the authorities, Shri. Mandal Anjaiah, claiming to be ancestor of the contesting respondents, preferred a writ petition before the Andhra Pradesh High Court, in No. 1051 of 1966, inter-alia, seeking a writ of prohibition or direction restraining the respondents in the petition from auctioning the ""disputed lands"" and to direct the authorities to decide the representations/ petitions filed by the writ petitioner. The Regional Settlement Commissioner/Custodian of Evacuee property was arrayed as one of the respondents to the proceedings. In his affidavit dated 21.08.1967, he had averred that the notice as required under Section 7 of the Evacuee Property Act read with Rule 6 of the Rules notices had been issued to all the parties interested in the disputed lands. 10) During the pendency of the writ petition, a portion of the land was allotted to one Smt. Eshwari Bai, and therefore, she was impleaded as one of the respondents in the writ petition. During the pendency of this writ petition, other contesting respondents had filed a Revision Petition under Section 27 of the Evacuee Property Act before the Deputy Custodian General, Jaisalmer House, New Delhi, to revise the 6 notification dated 11.12.1952 declaring the disputed lands as evacuee property. 11) The writ petition came to be dismissed by the High Court vide its order dated 14.06.1968 on the ground that the claim of the respondents is highly belated and they have also not exhausted the alternate remedy provided under the provisions of the Evacuee Property Act . The order passed by the Court has some relevance and, therefore, the same is extracted. It reads :- ""In this application for the issue of a writ under Article 226 of the Constitution, what is sought to be challenged by the petitioner is an order of the Deputy Custodian of Evacuee Property under Section 7 of the Administration of Evacuee Property Act declaring certain properties as evacuee properties. The notification was made on 11.12.1952. The petitioner did not avail himself of the remedy provided under Section 24 of the Act by way of an appeal. In fact, in 1955 and again in 1957 and 1959, he appears to have approached the Deputy Custodian with a request that the land should not be treated as evacuee property and on all these occasions, he was informed that he should go in appeal and not file review applications. It is not open to the petitioner without preferring an appeal, to approach this court at a late stage with a petition for the issue of a writ. There are no merits in this writ petition and it is therefore dismissed with costs."" 7 12) After the dismissal of the writ petition, some portion of the lands was allotted to Shri. Gopaldas and Shri. Jangimal on 15.09.1968 and to Shri. Mathuradas (legal heir of Shri. Valiram Hiramal) on 21.11.1968. Sanads (Transfer of Titles and Rights) were also issued to them and their names were recorded in the revenue records. 13) As we have already noticed, some of the legal representatives of late Mandal Bucham had approached the Deputy Custodian General, New Delhi by filing a revision petition under Section 27 of the Evacuee Property Act, inter alia questioning the notification dated 11.12.1952. The Deputy Custodian General vide his order dated 25.09.1970, had allowed the revision petition and remanded the case to Custodian- cum-Collector, Hyderabad District for re-determination of the evacuee nature of the lands after affording an opportunity of hearing to all the parties. 14) After such remand, Collector-cum-Deputy Custodian of Evacuee Property had conducted a re-enquiry and he had concluded that there was no evidence to show that late Rahim Baksh Khan came to be the owner of the land in pursuance of an auction by the Court in execution of any money decree. Hence, the Collector-cum-Deputy Custodian 8 vide order dated 28.05.1979 came to the conclusion that since there were no records available to the contrary, Shri. Mandal Bucham and the other contesting respondents continue to be the owners of the disputed lands. 15) Aggrieved by the aforesaid order, the allottees had filed a Revision Petition before the Chief Settlement Commissioner of Evacuee Property, Hyderabad under the Displaced Persons Act, who, by an order dated 27.10.1979, had called for the records of the case in order to review the aforementioned order of the Collector-cum- Deputy Custodian dated 28.05.1979. It appears that in view of the pendency of the proceedings, the Tahsildar refused to give possession of the ""disputed lands"" to the allottees (who had sanads in their name) in the light of the aforesaid order of the Collector-cum- Deputy Custodian, Hyderabad District. 16) The Chief Settlement Commissioner of Evacuee Property, by his order dated 11.05.1983, set aside the aforesaid order of the Collector- cum- Deputy Custodian, and declared that the said property belonged to late Rahim Baksh Khan and that by virtue of the Notification No. 9 55 in NO CE/4064 to 4080 of 1952, the disputed lands are evacuee property. 17) Once again, the contesting respondents had filed a revision petition under Section 33 of the Displaced Persons Act before the Secretary, Revenue Department, Govt. of Andhra Pradesh to revise/review the aforesaid order, which came to be rejected vide order dated 23.07.1983. 18) The contesting respondents filed a writ petition No. 7517 of 1983 before the High Court of Andhra Pradesh, inter alia, requesting the court to direct the authorities under the Displaced Persons Act to initiate suo-moto proceedings to determine the claim of ownership of the disputed lands. The High Court, by its order dated 26.07.1988, dismissed the writ petition, inter alia holding that it cannot compel any authority to initiate and dispose of the suo moto proceedings under Section 33 of the Displaced Persons Act. 19) The contesting respondents filed another Writ Petition No.17722 of 1990 on 13.11.1990 (from which the impugned judgment has arisen) before the High Court, inter alia requesting the High Court to issue a writ or order directing the Commissioner, Survey Settlement and Land 10 Records/Chief Settlement Commissioner, Evacuee Property, Hyderabad to conduct an enquiry into questions of title of ""disputed lands"" and correctness of the declaration of the said property as evacuee property in pursuance of proceedings of the Chief Settlement Commissioner dated 27.10.1979. It is relevant to notice that the contesting respondents did neither seek for the quashing of the Notification No. 55 in NO CE /4064 to 4080 dated 11.12.1952, nor made the present appellant a party to the writ proceedings. Subsequently, on 13.03.1997, the prayer in the writ petition was sought to be amended to include a prayer to quash the Notification No. 55 in NO CE 4064 to 4080 dated 11.12.1952, which was allowed on 27.08.1998. As the present appellant was not made party to the proceeding, it sought to implead itself by filing an application on 22.01.1999, and the same was allowed on 27.08.1999. 20) By the impugned judgment dated 27.04.2000, the learned Division Bench of the High Court allowed the writ petition by setting aside the order passed by the Chief Settlement Commissioner dated 11.05.1983 and restored the order passed by the Collector-cum-Deputy Custodian of Evacuee Property dated 28.07.1979. Aggrieved by the Judgment 11 and order passed, the appellant-Shankar Co-operative Housing Society has come before us in these civil appeals. 21) The subject matter of the Civil Appeal No. 4100 of 2000 pertains to the lands in Survey No. 152 admeasuring about 13.17 acres. These lands were originally allotted to Mathura Das on 26.11.1968, Subsequently, Mathura Das has executed General Power of Attorney (GPA), in favour of P.H. Hasanand and Chandumal dated 19.12.1966. Before us, the appellant -P.H. Hasanand as General Power of Attorney Holder of the late Mathura Das (who died on 30.5.1970) is assailing the Judgment and order of the Division Bench of the High Court in W.P. 17722 of 1990 dated 27.4.2000. It is relevant to mention that the Special Leave Petition filed by Mathura Das through his legal representatives has been dismissed by an order made by this Court dated 13.8.2007 on the ground of delay. 22) The subject matter in Civil Appeal No. 4101 of 2000 pertains to lands in Survey nos. 9,11,140,142,143,676 and 677, admeasuring about 20.27 acres. These lands were originally allotted to Smt. Eswari Bai on 30.11.1966. During her life time, she had executed a General Power of Attorney in favour of Thakur Hadanani on 06.08.1999. 12 During the pendency of the appeal, Smt. Eswari Bai expired. The application filed by Thakur Hadanani to bring legal representatives of Smt. Eswari bai was dismissed by this Court vide its order dated 30.03.2010 as General Power of Attorney holder of deceased has no locus- standi to file the appeal. In this appeal, the appellants before us are (1) P. Laxmi Patni, who is the son-in-law of P.M. Rao; (2) Vidya Devi, legal representative of Seetha Devi wife of Gopal Das and (3) Thakur Das is minor and represented by Smt. Vidya Devi. 23) One of the appellants before us is a co-operative society, styled as Shankara Co-op. Housing Society Ltd. [hereinafter referred to as `the society']. The said society has 600 members who are Government employees. The society has purchased the lands in disputes from the General Power of Attorney holders of three of the original allottees, namely, Shri. Gopaldas, Shri. Jangimal and Shri. Mathuradas, by paying the entire sale consideration. It is asserted that the Society, after obtaining permission from the competent authorities, has allotted residential plots carved out of the ""disputed lands"" to its members. 24) We have heard Shri. P.S. Narasimha, learned senior counsel and Shri. C. Mukund, learned counsel for the appellants and Shri. Ranjit 13 Kumar and Shri. L. Nageshwar Rao, learned senior counsel for the respondents. The State of Andhra Pradesh is represented by Shri. T.V. Ratnam, learned counsel. 25) Shri. C. Mukund, learned counsel who appears for the appellants in C.A. No. 4100 of 2000 and C.A. No. 4101 of 2000, submits apart from others, that the delay and laches on the part of the contesting respondents in approaching various authorities for redressal of their grievances, would disentitle them to claim any reliefs. It is submitted that repeated representations filed before the authorities would not be a ground to condone the delay and it is further submitted that there is inordinate delay in filing the writ petition from the date of notification issued under the Evacuee Property Act ; the claim of the respondents is barred by principles of constructive Resjudicata since in the writ petition filed by the respondents before Andhra Pradesh High Court, the plea of non-service of notice on the interested persons while declaring the said lands as an evacuee property was not raised, though it was available to them; that the question of facts as to title of the said lands, etc., could not have been gone into by the High Court in its writ jurisdiction, under Article 226 of the Constitution; and that since the ""disputed lands"" have already been acquired under the Displaced 14 Persons Act , the contesting respondents cannot have any right, title and interest over those lands. 26) While elaborating the issues raised, Shri. Mukund, learned counsel, submits that right from the beginning, the contesting respondents have either approached the authorities under the Evacuee Property Act or approached the judicial forums belatedly, or have gone before the wrong forum seeking either incorrect or incomplete reliefs. He submits that the competent authority under the Evacuee Property Act had not only issued the individual notices to the evacuee but also public notice was also issued on 26.01.1951. He further states that the ancestors of the contesting respondents were served with a notice dated 15.02.1951. He also submits that there can be no dispute that the ""disputed lands"" belonged to late Rahim Baksh Khan, as his name was recorded in the land revenue records. He further submits that there was no challenge to the declaration of the lands as evacuee property upto the year 1955, and for the next 11 years, upto 1966, the contesting respondents made only repeated representations to the authorities, without approaching the proper judicial forum provided under the Evacuee Property Act . He further asserts, that even in 1966, when the first writ petition was filed, the only prayer that was made 15 was to set aside the action of the Tahsildar seeking to auction the lands for granting Ek saala lease and not to quash the Notification No. 55 dated 11.12.1952, which had declared the disputed lands as evacuee property. He points out that there was no averment in the writ petition filed in the year 1966 regarding non-service of the notice, which is one of the principal grounds taken by the contesting respondents in the subsequent writ petition. Shri. Mukund further asserts that at no point of time prior to the 1997 amendment to the impugned writ petition, a challenge was made to the Notification No. 55 dated 11.12.1952, declaring the lands as evacuee property. He then referred to the counter affidavit filed by the State Government before the High Court in the 1966 writ petition which states that the contesting respondents were in possession of the land on the basis of Ek Saala or annual lease for the purpose of cultivation, and they had not paid the lease amount, and when their eviction was being attempted, they claimed ownership. Subsequently, even after the dismissal of the 1966 writ petition, Shri. Mukund submits that the contesting respondents again did not pursue the correct remedies after the 1983 order. In summation, Shri. Mukund contends that the contesting respondents did not take any steps from the time the notice 16 was issued [period between 1951 to 1955], after which they made repeated representations to the authorities, which came to be rejected [period between 1955 to 1959] and then filed the writ petition in 1966 [without doing anything for 7 years for the period between 1959 to 1966]. After this, he states even pursuant to the 1983 Order, again they did not follow the correct course, till the filing of the writ petition in the year 1990. Even when the writ petition was filed, the notification declaring the said lands as evacuee property was not challenged. In other words, Shri. Mukund asserts that every time the contesting respondents raised their voice in protest, they did it before a wrong forum or seeking the wrong or incomplete reliefs. 27) The learned counsel further submits that a person who seeks intervention of the court under Article 226 of the Constitution should give satisfactory explanation of his failure to assert his claim at an earlier date. The excuse for his procrastination should find a place in the petition submitted by him and the facts relied upon by him should be set out clearly in the body of the petition. An excuse that the contesting respondents were making repeated representations before various forums cannot merit serious consideration. In aid of his submission, the learned counsel has invited our attention to the 17 observations made by this court in City and Industrial Development Cooperation Vs. Dosu Andershir Bhiwandiwala and Anr. (2009) 1 SCC 168 (Paras 26-30), S. S. Balu and Another Vs. State of Kerala and others ( 2009) 2 SCC 479(Para 17), New Delhi Municipal Council Vs. Pan Singh and others ( 2007) 9 SCC 278 (paras 17-18) and K.V. Rajalakshmiah Setty & Anr. Vs. State of Mysore and Anr . (1967) 2 SCR 70. 28) In support of his second submission, Shri. Mukund invites our attention to the judgment and order in Writ Petition No.1051 of 1966 dated 14.06.1968 and submits that the same had been decided not only on merits but also on the ground that the writ petitioners had not availed the alternate remedy available under the Act. Alternatively, the learned counsel contends that non-service of notice as required under Section 7 of the Evacuee Property Act and the Rules framed thereunder was not raised, though the same was available to the contesting respondents and therefore, they could not have been permitted to take that plea in the subsequent writ petition filed. Therefore, subsequent writ petition from which, the present appeal arises, is barred by the principles analogous to res judicata. In aid of his submission, our attention is drawn to the decisions of this court in 18 Thakore Sobhey Singh Vs. Thakur Jai Singh and others (1968) 2 SCR 848, Mohan lal Goenka Vs. Beney Krishan Mukher Jee and others (1953) SCR 377 and Shashivraj Gopalji Vs. Ed. Appakath Ayissa and others 1949 PC 302. 29) Leaned counsel Shri. Mukund further urged that it is settled law that the fact finding task undertaken by the High Court, which is evident from the impugned judgment, is not warranted in a writ petition filed under Article 226 of the Constitution of India. He attempts to make good his argument by reading out passages from the impugned judgment, and attempts to impress upon us that the prolixity of the judgment clearly showed that the questions of fact had been gone into by the High Court while granting reliefs to the respondents. This, according to the learned counsel, is impermissible. In aid of his submission, the learned counsel has invited our attention to the observations made by this Court in the case of Surya Dev Rai Vs. Ramchander Rai and others ( 2003) 6 SCC 675, Ranjeet Singh Vs. Ravi Prakash ( 2004) 3 SCC 682 and Karnataka State Industrial Investment and Development Corporation Ltd. Vs. Cavalet India Ltd . and others (2005) 4 SCC 456. 19 30) Shri. Mukund submits that once the `disputed lands' are acquired under the Displaced Persons Act and allotted to the displaced persons, the Deputy Custodian of Evacuee Property will have no jurisdiction to initiate any proceedings under the Evacuee Property Act . He submits that the object of the two legislations are such that the Evacuee Property Act enabled that Government to first identify property as evacuee property and notify the same, after which, the Government would acquire such property under the Displaced Persons Act and distribute the same to the displaced persons. He contended, once such acquisition and redistribution take place under the Displaced Persons Act, the Deputy Custodian loses all his jurisdiction under the Evacuee Property Act to deal with the evacuee property. In other words, he contends that once property was distributed under the Displaced Persons Act to the displaced persons, it loses its evacuee status, and the status of such land had attained finality, and the same cannot be challenged. Reference is made to the observation of this court in the case of Major Gopal Singh and Others Vs. Custodian Evacuee Property (1962) 1 SCR 328, Basant Ram Vs. Union of India (1962) Supp. 2 SCR 733 and Defedar Niranjan Singh and another Vs. Custodian Evacuee Property and another (1962) 1 SCR 214. 20 31) Shri Mukund assails the judgment and order of the High Court as perverse on the ground: (a) that the High Court has not taken into consideration the fact that the contesting respondents had taken the lands on an Ek Saala lease, for which they defaulted in making payment; (b) that the High Court had completely overlooked the Order passed by the Chief Settlement Commissioner dated 11.05.1983; (c) that the plea of notice, not being served, was not taken in the writ petition filed in the year 1966. Therefore, it was not open for the contesting respondents to raise such contention in the subsequent proceedings. 32) With regard to the question of non-service of notice, Shri. Mukund would contend that if the contesting respondents were in possession of the said lands, as claimed by them, they cannot plead that they were not served with the notice issued under sub-section (1) of Section 7 of the Evacuee Property Act. He further submits that the conduct of the contesting respondents cannot be brushed aside and had a very vital bearing on this case. He also points out that the revenue records produced by the State Government before the High Court would show late Rahim Baksh Khan as the owner of the property, a fact that was overlooked by the High Court in the impugned judgment. 21 33) Shri. P.S. Narasimha, learned senior counsel appearing for the Society, prefaces his submission with the purpose and object behind the enactment of the Evacuee Property Act and the Displaced Persons Act. He contends that property that was acquired under the Evacuee Property Act as evacuee property was redistributed to displaced persons for a consideration, and that the sanads issued were actually sale deeds. He further states that there were no prohibition/restriction in the sanads for alienation of the property under the provisions of the Displaced Persons Act and, therefore, gave finality to question of ownership of the lands. While adopting the submissions of Shri. Mukund, the learned senior counsel would contend that once the Displaced Persons Act comes into operation, the operation of the Evacuee Property Act comes to an end. He further emphasized that the contesting respondents could not be permitted to take advantage of their own wrongs, especially when third party rights had already been created. He also urged that the subsequent writ petition filed by the contesting respondents should have been dismissed by the High Court for the same reason for which earlier writ petition was dismissed inasmuch as the cause of action in both the petitions being the same, 22 the subsequent writ petition would be barred by the principles analogous to res judicata. 34) Shri. T.V. Ratnam, learned counsel appearing for the State of Andhra Pradesh, submits that the Evacuee Property Act is a complete code by itself, with a mechanism to deal with the question of evacuee nature of the property. He states that once it is decided by the Custodian, in exercise of his powers under the Act, that the property was an evacuee property, then it was not available for challenge in a writ petition filed under Article 226 of the Constitution. Such declaration can be questioned only by filing either an appeal or revision, as provided under the Act. He further states that the contesting respondents did not follow the procedure prescribed under the Act. Even when the Revision filed by them was rejected by the Custodian, the same was never challenged. The learned counsel pointed out in the pahani pathra or revenue records that persons other than the contesting respondents were also in possession of the land, along with Shri. Mandal Anjaiah, and states that this possession was in pursuance of the Ek Saala lease that was granted in their favour. The learned counsel points out that the revenue records would clearly prove that it is the Custodian who was the owner and in possession of the lands in 23 dispute. He also emphasized that there was inordinate delay in challenging the notification dated 11.12.1952 and the High Court ought not to have entertained the writ petition filed in the year 1990 and unsettle the settled things. 35) Per contra, Shri. Ranjit Kumar, learned senior counsel, submitted that though late Rahim Baksh Khan had a money decree in his favour against Shri. Mandal Bucham, an ancestor of the contesting respondents, the same was never executed. He further states that there was no warrant for execution against the disputed lands in favour of late Rahim Baksh Khan. He submits that there is nothing on record to show how the rights of the contesting respondents got extinguished. It is his further submission that a proper enquiry, as required under Evacuee Property Act , was not conducted with regard to the nature of the lands. He submits that from the records, it can be made out that the Collector was informed by the Tahsildar that the lands in question were in the name of Mandal Bucham. He also states, that the requirements of personal notice as per Rule 6 of the Administration of Evacuee Property (Central) Rules, 1950 [hereinafter referred to as `the EP Rules'] were not complied with. He also states that the contesting 24 respondents have always been in possession of the said lands, as admitted by the Government, in its counter affidavit. 36) With regard to the question of delay and laches which was the forefront of the submission of Shri. Mukund, learned counsel, he submits that the contesting respondents, who were poor and illiterate farmers, have been continuously making representations and filing petitions before the various authorities, from the time they had the knowledge of the status of the property being declared as evacuee till the filing of the writ petition in 1966. He further states that since they were in possession of the land, when they came to know that the said lands were being auctioned, they moved the High Court under Article 226 of the Constitution, without further delay. He contends that there were no third party rights at least till 1966, and that the contesting respondents were in possession of the lands and were cultivating the same, and when their possession was threatened, they moved the High Court for appropriate reliefs. It is further submitted that the High Court has merely disposed of the writ petition filed only on the ground that the petitioners therein had not exhausted alternate remedy available to them under the Evacuee Property Act . 25 37) Shri. Ranjit Kumar further submits that the lands allotted to Shri. Gopal Das and Shri. Jangimal that were made in 1968, and were cancelled by the Custodian, as the two allotees did not come forward to take possession of the same, vide order dt. 21.11.1987. With regard to the lands allotted to Shri. Mathuradas, the learned senior counsel would submit that this Court, by an order dt. 13.08.2007, dismissed the Special Leave Petition filed by the legal representatives of Shri. Mathuradas against the impugned judgment, on the ground of delay, as well as on merits. 38) The learned senior counsel then drew our attention to the revision undertaken by an order of the Dy. Custodian General in the year 1970, who found that Shri. Mandal Bucham was the pattedar and that the status of the lands required enquiry as there was no evidence to the claim that late Rahim Baksh Khan had purchased the said lands in an auction, as claimed by the appellants. Since the question of title was involved, the matter was rightly remanded back to the Collector-cum- Dy. Custodian, who, vide order dt. 28.05.1979, came to the conclusion that the lands were owned by the ancestors of the contesting respondents and the revenue records support their case. 26 39) The learned senior counsel also submits that the Order passed by the Chief Settlement Commissioner dated 11.05.1983 is manifestly illegal, as the Collector-cum-Dy. Custodian, was not one of those authorities whose order could have been revised by the Chief Settlement Commissioner in exercise of his jurisdiction under Section 24 of the Displaced Persons Act. Since the powers conferred under the aforesaid Section is only to revise those orders passed by the officers notified under the provisions of Displaced Persons Act. Therefore, it is argued that the said order is one without jurisdiction. 40) Shri. Ranjit Kumar rebuts the claim of the appellants that notice was served on the contesting respondents. He states that notice could not have been served on legal heirs of late Rahim Baksh Khan, who were in Pakistan, and were unlikely to come back; no notice was issued to the contesting respondents. On a query from the bench regarding as to why the contesting respondents held an Ek Saala lease if they owned the property, he submits that there was absolutely no record to show that the rights of the contesting respondents had been extinguished. He further submits in rebuttal to the contention of the appellants of pursuing the wrong remedies, by stating that a writ petition under Article 226 was the only remedy available, as Section 36 of the 27 Displaced Persons Act bars the jurisdiction of civil courts. He also states that the argument of the appellants that once the lands are acquired by the Central Government under the Displaced Persons Act, the property ceases to be evacuee property and becomes the property of the Central Government, depends on the factor that the property is notified as evacuee property after following the due procedure prescribed under the Evacuee Property Act and the Rules framed thereunder. He further urged that if the property in question is not evacuee property, there is no question of the coming into operation of the Displaced Persons Act. 41) Shri. Ranjit Kumar further submits that the appellants are not the original allottees and they are only subsequent purchasers, from the general power of attorney (`GPA') holders of the original allottees. In some cases, he contends, the GPA holders have sold the property after the death of the principal, and in other cases, GPA holders of GPA holders of original allottees have sold the lands and in both cases, he submits that the same is impermissible in law. He further contends that the allotment to Shri. Gopal Das and Shri. Jangimal was cancelled in the year 1989, the Special Leave Petition of Shri. Mathuradas had been dismissed in the year 2007, and that this Court had disallowed 28 the substitution of the legal heirs of Smt. Eshwari Bai, on her death, due to which appellants cannot maintain these proceedings. 42) In summing up his contention, the learned senior counsel states that the Notification dated 11.12.1952 issued under sub-Section (1) of Section 7 of the Evacuee Property Act was manifestly illegal and the disputed lands could not have been declared as evacuee property, as the owners were not evacuee; that the argument of delay and laches was not available to the appellants, as the original allottees who had claimed that they weren't made a party have been heard at all stages right from the first writ petition in the year 1966; that the question of Ek Saala lease cannot be put against the respondents as the name of the contesting respondents was recorded in the Revenue records as owner of the lands; that the proceedings under the Displaced Persons Act can take place only if the proceedings under the Evacuee Property Act are validly made; that the proceedings under Section 24 of the Displaced Persons Act culminating in the order of Chief Settlement Commissioner in the year 1983 is illegal, for the reason it can be done only of those orders passed by the officers notified in Section 24 of the Act, and that the order of Chief Settlement Commissioner is without jurisdiction and hence is a nullity; that the High Court could 29 correct any manifest illegality, such as declaring the disputed lands as evacuee property, under its writ jurisdiction, which need not be interfered with by this Court under Article 136; that the disputed questions of fact had to be necessarily gone into by the High Court under its writ jurisdiction due to the bar of jurisdiction of other Courts by virtue of Section 36 of the Displaced Persons Act; that the contesting respondents were in possession of the lands and continues to be so even till this day and this position is accepted by the State Government in the counter affidavit filed before this court; assuming that there was some delay on the part of the contesting respondents for redressal of their grievances before various forums, since the same has been condoned by the writ court, this court need not interfere with the said order. 43) Shri. L. Nageshwar Rao, learned senior counsel who appears for the contesting respondents in the Special Leave Petition filed by the State, supplemented the arguments of Shri. Ranjit Kumar. He also submitted that the only issue was whether the nature of the property was such that it fell within the ambit of evacuee property or not. He also submits that if the facts were not gone into by the High Court, there could be no decision on this aspect, and once this aspect was decided 30 in favour of the contesting respondents, then nothing remains to be decided by this Court. 44) The learned counsel have referred to several case laws for the many propositions they have canvassed before us. The relevance of these decision we will deal with at appropriate stage. 45) In the background of these facts, the following questions arise for our consideration and decision: (1) Whether the contesting respondents have been guilty of delay and laches. (2) Whether the dismissal of the writ petition No. 1051 of 1966 by the High Court decided the matter fully and finally. (3) Whether the lands in question are evacuee property as defined under the Evacuee Property Act . (4) What is the effect and the consequence of the notification issued under Section 12(1) of the Displaced Persons Act. (5) Whether the High Court could have gone into the facts under its writ jurisdiction. 46) Re : Delay and Laches : - Delay and laches is one of the factors that requires to be borne in mind by the High Courts when they exercise their discretionary power under Article 226 of the Constitution of India. In an appropriate case, the High Court may refuse to invoke its 31 extraordinary powers if there is such negligence or omission on the part of the applicant to assert his rights taken in conjunction with the lapse of time and other circumstances. The Privy Council in Lindsay Petroleum Company Vs. Prosper Armstrong Hurd etc; (1874) 5 PC 221 at page 229, which was approved by this Court in Moon Mills Ltd. Vs. Industrial Courts AIR 1967 SC 1450 and Maharashtra State Road Transport Corporation Vs. Balwant Regular Motor Service AIR 1969 SC 329, has stated :- ""Now the doctrine of laches in Courts of Equity is not an arbitrary or a technical doctrine. Where it would be practically unjust to give a remedy, either because the party has, by his conduct, done that which might fairly be regarded as equivalent to a waiver of it, or where by his conduct and neglect he has, though perhaps not waiving that remedy, yet put the other party in a situation in which it would not be reasonable to place him if the remedy were afterwards to be asserted in either of these cases, lapse of time and delay are most material. But in every case, if an argument against relief, which otherwise would be just, is founded upon mere delay, that delay of course not amounting to a bar by any statute of limitations, the validity of that defence must be tried upon principles substantially equitable. Two circumstances, always important in such cases, are, the length of the delay and the nature of the acts done during the interval, which might affect either party and cause a balance of justice or injustice in taking the one course or the other, so far as relates to the remedy."" 32 47) In Amrit Lal Berry Vs. CCE (1975) 4 SCC 714, this Court took the view that ""if a petitioner has been so remiss or negligent as to approach the Court for relief after an inordinate and unexplained delay, he certainly jeopardises his claims as it may become inequitable, with circumstances altered by lapse of time and other facts, to enforce, a fundamental right to the detriment of similar claims of innocent third persons."" 48) In State of Maharashtra Vs. Digambar (1995) 4 SCC 683, this Court observed that ""unless the facts and circumstances of the case at hand clearly justify the laches or undue delay, writ petitioners are not entitled to any relief against any body including the State."" 49) In Shiv Dass Vs. Union of India (2007) 9 SCC 274, this Court opined that ""the High Court does not ordinarily permit a belated resort to the extraordinary remedy because it is likely to cause confusion and public inconvenience and bring in its train new injustices, and if writ jurisdiction is exercised after unreasonable delay, it may have the effect of inflicting not only hardship and inconvenience but also injustice on third parties. It was pointed out that when writ jurisdiction is invoked, unexplained delay coupled with the creation of 33 third party rights in the meantime is an important factor which also weighs with the High Court in deciding whether or not to exercise such jurisdiction."" 50) In City and Industrial Development Corporation Vs. Dosu Aardeshir Bhinandiwala and others (supra), this court held :- ""It is well settled and needs no restatement at our hands that under Article 226 of the Constitution, the jurisdiction of a High Court to issue appropriate writs particularly a writ of Mandamus is highly discretionary. The relief cannot be claimed as of right. One of the grounds for refusing relief is that the person approaching the High Court is guilty of unexplained delay and the laches. Inordinate delay in moving the court for a Writ is an adequate ground for refusing a Writ. The principle is that courts exercising public law jurisdiction do not encourage agitation of stale claims and exhuming matters where the rights of third parties may have accrued in the interregnum."" 51) Shri Ranjit Kumar, learned senior counsel for contesting respondents, invites our attention to the observations made by this court in the case of State of M.P. and others Vs. Nandlal Jaiswal and others (1986) 4 SCC 566, wherein this court has stated ""this rule of laches or delay is not a rigid rule which can be cast in a straitjacket formula, for there may be cases where despite delay and creation of third party rights the High Court may still in the exercise of its discretion interfere and 34 grant relief to the petitioner. But, such cases where the demand of justice is so compelling that the High Court would be inclined to interfere inspite of delay or creation of third party rights would by their very nature be few and for between. Ultimately it would be a matter within the discretion of the Court ex-hypotheses every discretion must be exercised fairly and justly so as to promote justice and not to defeat it."" 52) Reliance is also placed on the observations made by this Court in M/s Dehri Rohtas Light Railway Company Ltd. Vs. District Board, Bhojpur and others (1992) 2 SCC 598, wherein it is observed : ""The rule which says that the Court may not enquire into belated and stale claim is not a rule of law but a rule of practice based on sound and proper exercise of discretion. Each case must depend upon its own facts. It will all depend on what the breach of the fundamental right and the remedy claimed are and how delay arose. The principle on which the relief to the party on the grounds of laches or delay is denied is that the rights which have accrued to others by reason of the delay in filing the petition should not be allowed to be disturbed unless there is a reasonable explanation for the delay. The real test to determine delay in such cases is that the petitioner should come to the writ court before a parallel right is created and that the lapse of time is not attributable to any laches or negligence. The test is not to physical running of time. Where the circumstances justifying the conduct exists, the illegality which is manifest cannot be sustained on the sole ground of laches."" 35 53) The relevant considerations, in determining whether delay or laches should be put against a person who approaches the writ court under Article 226 of the Constitution is now well settled. They are: (1) there is no inviolable rule of law that whenever there is a delay, the court must necessarily refuse to entertain the petition; it is a rule of practice based on sound and proper exercise of discretion, and each case must be dealt with on its own facts. (2) The principle on which the court refuses relief on the ground of laches or delay is that the rights accrued to others by the delay in filing the petition should not be disturbed, unless there is a reasonable explanation for the delay, because court should not harm innocent parties if their rights had emerged by the delay on the part of the petitioners. (3) The satisfactory way of explaining delay in making an application under Article 226 is for the petitioner to show that he had been seeking relief elsewhere in a manner provided by law. If he runs after a remedy not provided in the Statute or the statutory rules, it is not desirable for the High Court to condone the delay. It is immaterial what the petitioner chooses to believe in regard to the remedy. (4) No hard and fast rule, can be laid down in this regard. Every case shall have to be decided 36 on its own facts. (5) That representations would not be adequate explanation to take care of the delay. 54) Let us now advert to the contentions canvassed by learned counsel in this regard. Mr. Mukund, learned counsel for the appellants, submitted that the contesting respondent during the period 1951 till 1955, had not taken any steps for redressal of their grievance, if any, including challenging the notification issued by the competent authority under the Evacuee Property Act dated 11.12.1952. He further submits that from 1955 till 1959, the contesting respondents were making representations before forums which could not have given them reliefs. In spite of the counsel of the authorities that they should file either appeal or revision against the notification issued under the Evacuee Property Act , they did not resort to those remedies. It is further contended that from the period 1959 till 1966, they did not choose to approach any authorities nor took any judicial action. The learned counsel submits that for the first time, they approached the High Court by filing the writ petition some time in the year 1966, inter-alia, claiming the relief of certiorari to quash the action of the authorities for auction of the acquired lands under the Displaced Persons Act for grant of Ek saala lease, but, at the time of hearing of 37 the petition, they advanced a new case by contending that an appropriate writ requires to be issued to quash the notification issued under the Evacuee Property Act . It is further submitted that the High Court refused to grant the relief on the ground of delay and laches in approaching the court for quashing the notification of the year 1952 and further on the ground that the writ petitioner has not availed the alternate remedies provided under the Evacuee Property Act . The learned counsel submits by this order that the writ court has given a finding that at a belated stage, the writ petitioner cannot challenge the notification issued on 11.12.1952 under the provisions of the Evacuee Property Act . The learned counsel further submits that after disposal of the writ petition, the contesting respondents had approached forums which could not have entertained their claim nor could have granted any relief. It is further submitted even assuming that the respondents were knocking at the doors of the wrong forum, the same should not be held against them, may not come to their aid, since the third party rights are created by allotment of the Evacuee Property to the Displaced Persons under the Displaced Persons Act. He further submits that though the writ petition filed by one of the contesting respondents was dismissed by the writ court, the other contesting 38 respondents suppressing the filing of the writ petition and its dismissal, had filed a revision petition under Section 27 of the Evacuee Property Act before the Deputy Custodian General, New Delhi sometime in the year 1967 inter-alia questioning the Notification dated 11.12.1952 declaring the `disputed lands' as Evacuee Property. Though they succeeded before that authority, the same was short lived and the said order was revised by the Chief Settlement Commissioner at the instance of the allottees by his order dated 11.05.1983. The learned counsel further submits that instead of questioning the said order before a proper forum, they approached the State Government to revise the order by the Chief Settlement Commissioner and when the revision petition was returned, they approached the High Court by filing a writ petition to direct the State Government to invoke its power of `Suo-Moto' revision, which came to be rejected on 26.07.1988. Therefore, the learned counsel submits that the time spent from 1983 till 1988 cannot be considered to be satisfactory explanation since they were seeking reliefs not in a manner provided by the law. The learned counsel submits that after about two years of the dismissal of the writ petition, they filed yet another Writ Petition No.17722 of 1990, inter-alia, seeking initially a 39 direction to respondent No.3 to conduct an enquiry into the question of title of disputed lands and also the correctness of the declaration of the said property as evacuee property, and again after almost seven years of filing of the writ petition, an amendment was sought for quashing the Notification dated 11.12.1952. Therefore, the High Court ought not have entertained the writ petition in view of the inordinate and unexplained delay. 55) Shri. Ranjit Kumar contends that the contesting respondents were and are in continuous physical possession of the lands and it is only when their possession was threatened in the year 1966 by the Tahsildar for auctioning the lands to grant Ek saala lease, they had approached the High Court and prior to that, they were making representations before the authorities for redressal of their grievance. The learned senior counsel submits that the appellants have not placed any material before this Court that the contesting respondents were dispossessed from their lands and an inference should be drawn in favour of the respondents. He also submits that though Sanads were given to the allottees, they were never put in possession of the property. He states that even the Sanads so granted were cancelled on a later date since the allottee could not take possession of lands. It is also contended 40 that if there is any delay, it could only be after the Chief Settlement Commissioner had allowed the revision petition filed by the allottees by setting aside the earlier order passed by the Deputy Custodian in the year 1979. He further submits that the contesting respondent thereafter had approached the State Government to initiate its suo- moto revisional powers to revise the order passed by the Chief Settlement Commissioner and since that was not done, they immediately filed a writ petition for appropriate direction and the said writ petition was disposed of only in the year 1988 and immediately thereafter, they had approached the High Court by filing a writ petition for appropriate reliefs. Therefore, he submits that firstly, there was no delay or laches on the part of the contesting respondents in approaching the authorities for redressal of their grievances, secondly, assuming there is some delay, the same has been satisfactorily explained and lastly, when there was manifest illegality in the proceedings of the authorities both under the Evacuee Property Act and the Displaced Persons Act, the same has been corrected by the learned Division Bench of the High Court and this Court need not disturb the finding of the High Court in exercise of its jurisdiction under Article 136 of the Constitution. 41 56) Since this issue requires to be answered in the light of the pleadings of the contesting respondents in the writ petition filed by them before the High Court, it is desirable firstly to notice what was their explanation pleaded in approaching the writ court nearly after 28 years from the date of the notification issued under the Evacuee Property Act . We have carefully scanned through the pleadings in the writ petition and also the application filed for amendment nearly after eight years from the date of filing of the writ petition. There is no explanation, much less satisfactory explanation except a very casual statement in para 4 of the petition. Therein, it is said: ""4. That in the meanwhile, there have been various proceedings whereunder the petitioners repeatedly knocking the doors of various authorities challenging the very correctness of the proceedings treating the petitioners' lands as evacuee. However, no attempt was made to go to root of the case and to find out, if really said Rahim Bux or his family at time had any title, right or interest to be declared as evacuee. For no fault, the petitioners are sought to be deprived of their legitimate rights, without any justification or valid reason."" 57) In the counter affidavit filed by respondent No.13 (Shankar Co- operative Society), they had specifically contended ""that the writ petition is time barred and on the ground of latches, the writ petition is bound to be dismissed. The petitioners are seeking quashing the order 42 or notification of the year 1952 and an order of the quasi-judicial authority of the year 1983 and of 1990 [Para 2(d)]. In para 23 of the counter affidavit, they had also asserted, ""that the petitioners have referred to various representations alleged to have been made to the respondent authorities from time to time on various dates reflected in the petition. They did not choose to file copies of all representations. On the other hand, it is reliably learnt that it is falsely made and such representations are filed."" 58) The High Court, in the course of its judgment and order, notices the specific allegations made by the respondents in their counter affidavit filed and the contention of the learned counsel in regard to delay and laches on the part of the petitioners in approaching the Court. 59) While answering the aforesaid stand of the respondents in the writ petition, the Division Bench of the High Court refers to several orders passed by the authorities and then observes that ""from what is narrated above, the petitioners cannot be found fault with for any inaction or lapse and they had been waging tireless legal battle since last 45 years. Further, they did not leave any chance in the litigation."" Beyond this, the High Court has not stated anything with 43 regard to the explanation offered by the petitioner in approaching the Court, even according to them, nearly after 45 years. The High Court has not recorded any finding whatsoever and ignored such a plea of far-reaching consequence. 60) In the present case, the respondents in the writ petition had raised a specific plea of delay, as a bar to grant relief to the petitioners. In our view, it was perhaps necessary for the Court to have specifically dealt with this issue. It is now well settled that a person who seeks the intervention of the High Court under Article 226 , should give a satisfactory explanation of his failure to assert his claim at an earlier date. The excuse for procrastination should find a place in the petition filed before the Court and the facts relied upon by him should be set out clearly in the body of the petition. An excuse that he was agitating his claims before authorities by making repeated representations would not be satisfactory explanation for condoning the inordinate delay in approaching the Court. If a litigant runs after a remedy not provided in the Statute or the statutory rules, it cannot be a satisfactory explanation for condoning the delay in approaching the Court. 44 61) On this issue, we have heard the learned counsel for the parties in great detail, since the immoveable property rights of the parties are involved. In our considered view, there is no explanation, much less satisfactory explanation offered by the respondents in approaching the writ court after an inordinate delay of nearly 15 years from the date of the notification issued under the Evacuee Property Act . For the delay from 1952 to 1955, the contesting respondents would only submit that they were not aware of the notification issued under the Evacuee Property Act , since no notice was served on them, though a public notice was issued by the authority under the Evacuee Property Act . While explaining the delay of nearly eleven years from 1955 to 1966, they contend that they were in possession of the property and they were making representations before the authorities under the Evacuee Property Act for redressal of their grievance. The delay after the orders were passed by the Settlement Commissioner in the year 1983 till the writ petition was filed in the year 1990, it is explained that they had moved the State Government to suo-moto revise the order passed by the Chief Settlement Commissioner and since the State Government returned their request, they had approached the High Court to issue directions to the State Government to issue appropriate 45 directions. In our considered view, at every stage, there was inordinate delay in approaching the authorities for redressal of their grievance. As rightly contended by Shri. Mukund, learned counsel, even when they approached the authorities, they were claiming wrong reliefs or incomplete reliefs. Even when they filed the writ petition in the year 1990, they did not choose to question the correctness of the notification issued under the Evacuee Property Act but was questioned by way of filing an amendment application in the year 1998. There is some merit in the submission made by learned counsel for the contesting respondents that the petitioners in their pleadings before the writ court, had not even offered any explanation, much less satisfactory explanation, in approaching the court nearly after three decades from the date of notification issued under the Evacuee Property Act . It is now well settled that the power of the High Court under Article 226 of the Constitution to issue an appropriate writ, order or direction is discretionary. One of the grounds to refuse relief by a writ court is that the petitioner is guilty of delay and laches. Inordinate and unexplained delay in approaching the court in a writ is indeed an adequate ground for refusing to exercise discretion in favour of the petitioners therein. The unexplained delay on the part of 46 the petitioner in approaching the High Court for redressal of their grievances under Article 226 of the Constitution was sufficient to justify rejection of the petition. The other factor the High Court should have taken into consideration that during the period of delay, interest has accrued in favour of the third party and the condonatoin of unexplained delay would affect the rights of third parties. We are also of the view that reliance placed by Shri Ranjit Kumar on certain observations made by this Court would not assist him in the facts and circumstances of this case. While concluding on this issue, it would be useful to refer the observations made by the Court in the case of Municipal Council Vs. Shaha Hyder Baig (2002) 2 SCC 48, wherein it is stated that `delay defeats equity and that the discretionary relief of condonation can be had, provided one has not given by his conduct, given a go by to his rights'. 62) Re: Effect of the judgment and order of the High Court in W.P. No. 1051 of 1966:- While narrating the facts, we have referred to the judgment and order of the High Court in Writ Petition No. 1051 of 1966 dated 14.06.1968. The relief that was sought for by the petitioner therein 47 was to issue a writ or direction restraining the respondents from auctioning the lands in pursuance of the letter of Tahsildar, Medchal dated 29.6.1966. However, the High Court while dismissing the Writ Petition, specifically has observed that what was challenged by the petitioner in the Writ Petition was the order passed by the Deputy Custodian of Evacuee property under Section 7 of the Evacuee Property Act declaring certain properties as evacuee properties. The Court specifically notices the notification dated 11.12.1952 issued by the authorities under the Evacuee Property Act and observes that the petitioner had not availed the remedy provided under Section 24 of the Act, by way of an appeal. In conclusion, it observes that petitioner without preferring an appeal has approached the Court at a belated stage with a petition for issue of a writ. Accordingly, the High Court had dismissed the petition with costs. It is not in dispute nor it can be disputed that the said judgment and order has attained finality. Sri Mukund, learned counsel, submits that though petitioner had questioned the letter of the Tahsildar, Medchal for auctioning the lands for grant of Ek saala lease, at the time of the hearing of the petition, there is possibility of the learned counsel for the petitioner to have questioned the notification issued under the Evacuee Property 48 Act. Since by then, the petitioner had the knowledge of the notification issued under the Act, otherwise there was no reason for the High Court to have specifically noticed the notification dated 11.12.1952 issued under Section 7 of the Evacuee Property Act. However, Sri Ranjit Kumar, learned Senior counsel for the contesting respondents to get over this legal hurdle, submits that the writ petition was filed by Mandal Anjaiah,who was one of the legal representatives of late Mandal Buchaiah and the judgment and order passed by the Writ court cannot be put against the other legal representatives of the Mandal Buchaiah. The learned senior counsel also submits that after disposal of the writ petition, the other heirs of late Mandal Buchaiah had preferred a revision before the Deputy Custodian General, New Delhi under Section 27 of the Evacuee Property Act and the same was not only entertained but necessary relief was also granted to him. Therefore, the Judgment and order of the High Court would not affect the rights of the other legal heirs of late Mandal Buchaiah. 64) Before we consider the contentions of learned counsel, let us first notice the settled legal position in matters like the present case. 49 65) In Shakur Basti Shamshan Bhumi Sudhar Samiti v. Lt. Governor, NCT of Delhi (2007) 13 SCC 53, the order passed by the High Court for closure of cremation ground, in conformity with zonal development plan, had attained finality. This Court has held that any subsequent order passed in ignorance of the order of the High Court which has attained finality is nullity. It was further observed: ""40. The learned Subordinate Judge has also passed an order in a suit filed by one Balvant Rai in 1991. What was the nature of the decree passed by the Subordinate Judge has not been disclosed. The only contention raised in the list of dates is that the same was a collusive suit. With whom, the said Balvant Rai colluded or what was the nature and purport of the decree had not been disclosed. Some orders appear to have been passed also by the Additional District Judge. We do not know whether the Additional District Judge has passed the order in the same proceeding or in some other proceedings. If the judgments directing user of the land in conformity with the zonal development plan and further directing that a cremation ground should not be allowed to operate become final, an order passed in ignorance thereof would be a nullity.""[Emphasis supplied by us] 66) Once the order of the High Court has attained finality, then it is not open for the lower courts or even for the High Court to ignore the said Order. In A.P. Housing Board v. Mohd. Sadatullah , (2007) 6 SCC 566, it was held: 50 ""34. Though in the appeal filed by the A.P. Housing Board in the present proceedings, it was asserted that the decision of the High Court in Writ Petition No. 4194 of 1988 was not final as appeal was filed against the said decision , at the time of hearing of the appeal, it was admitted that no such appeal was filed against the judgment of the High Court and the decision had attained finality. The consequence of the decision of the High Court in the circumstances is that in respect of two acres of land, proceedings under the Land Acquisition Act were held bad, award nullity and the landowner continued to remain owner of the property with all rights, title and interest therein. 41. In our opinion, the learned counsel for the original petitioner landowners is right in contending that when the acquisition proceedings and award in respect of two acres of land was held bad and nullity by the High Court in previous proceedings, it was not open to the Special Court or the High Court to ignore the said order."" 67) The Finality of Order by the High Court has been considered and upheld by this Court in Hindustan Construction Co. Ltd. and Anr. v. Gopal Krishna Sengupta and Ors., (2003) 11 SCC 210. This Court has held: ""25. The question still remains whether, on facts of this case, the direction given in the Order dated 19th October, 2000 can be maintained. In the application there was no prayer to examine Pritika Prabhudesai. The prayer was to quash the proceedings and start trail afresh. There is no provision in law which permits this. Thus the application could not be allowed. Undoubtedly the High Court has proceeded 51 on the footing that this evidence is essential and necessary. Section 311 of the Criminal Procedure Code permits taking of evidence at any stage. The High Court undoubtedly felt that it was in the interest of all parties that necessary evidence be recorded at this stage itself. But the fact remains that the application for this very relief has been rejected on 6 th Novemb er, 1997. No appeal or revision was filed against that order. The Order dated 6th Novemb er, 1997 has therefore become final. Once such a relief has been refused and the refusal has attained finality, judicial propriety requires that it not be allowed to be reopened. The High Court was obviously not informed of the Order dated 6th Nove mber, 1997. Thus the High Court cannot be blamed. However as that Order has been brought to notice of this Court we cannot ignore it."" 68) In Food Corporation of India v. S.N. Nagarkar , (2002) 2 SCC 475, this Court has held: ""15. ... In the instant case, the writ petition filed by the respondent was allowed by judgment and order dated 6thMay, 1994 passed in Civil Writ Petition No. 4983 or 1993. That order attained finality as it was not appealed from. In execution proceedings, the appellant cannot go beyond the order passed by the Court in the writ petition and, therefore, what has to be considered is whether the High Court was right in holding that in terms of the order of the Court dated 6thMay, 1994 passed in Civil Writ Petition No. 4983 of 1993, the respondent is entitled to the arrears of pay and allowances with effect from the date of promotions. If the answer is in the affirmative, the question whether such relief ought to have been granted cannot be agitated in execution proceeding. We find considerable force in the submission urged on 52 behalf of the respondent. In these proceedings it is not permissible to go beyond the order of the learned Judge dated 6th M ay, 1994 passed in Civil Writ Petition No. 4983 of 1993. The execution application giving rise to the instant appeal was filed for implementing the order dated 6th May, 1994 and in such proceeding, it was not open to the appellant either to contend that the judgment and order dated 6th M ay, 1994 was erroneous or that it required modification. The judgment and order aforesaid having attained finality, has to be implemented without questioning its correctness. The appellant therefore, cannot be permitted to contend in these proceedings that the judgment and order dated 6thMay, 1994 was erroneous in as much as it directed the appellant to pay to the respondent arrears of salary with effect from the dates of promotion, and not from the dates the respondent actually joined the promotional posts."" 69) In Oriental Bank of Commerce v. Sunder Lal Jain and Anr . (2008) 2 SCC 280, the respondents had availed credit facility to the tune of `20 Lacs and defaulted in repaying the same to the Bank. The Bank declared their account as Non Performing Asset and initiated recovery proceedings against the respondents before the DRT, which has issued a recovery certificate in favour of the Bank. However, against this, respondents did not prefer any appeal, instead filed writ petition before the High Court. The High Court has stayed the execution proceedings and directed the bank to consider the respondent's case in terms of RBI guidelines. Aggrieved by this, 53 appellant Bank approached this Court against the order of the High Court. This Court observed that when a decree passed by the DRT had attained finality, then the proceedings for execution of decree cannot be stayed by High Court in an independent writ petition. This Court further held : ""13. The High Court, therefore, erred in issuing a writ of mandamus directing the appellant bank to declare the respondents' account as NPA from 31st March, 2000 and to apply the RBI Guidelines to their case and communicate the outstandings which shall be recoverable by quarterly instalments over a period of two years. The later part of the order passed by the High Court wherein a direction has been issued to stay the recovery proceedings and the recovery certificate issued against the respondents has been cancelled is also wholly illegal as the decree passed by the DRT had attained finality and proceedings for execution of decree could not be stayed in an independent writ petition when the respondents had not chosen to assail the decree by filing an appeal, which is a statutory remedy provided under Section 20 of Recovery of Debts Due to Banks and Financial Institutions Act, 1993."" 70) Doctrine of Amity and Comity requires the Court of Concurrent Jurisdiction to pass similar orders. In India Household and Healthcare Ltd. v. LG Household and Healthcare Ltd. , 2007 (5) SCC 510, this Court has held: 54 ""The doctrine of comity or amity required a court not to pass and order which would be in conflict with another order passed by a competent court of law."" It was further held: ""17. This aspect of the matter has been considered in A Treatise on the Law Governing Injunctions by Spelling and Lewis wherein it is stated: Section 8 . Conflict and loss of jurisdiction. --Where a court having general jurisdiction and having acquired jurisdiction of the subject- matter has issued an injunction, a court of concurrent jurisdiction will usually refuse to interfere by issuance of a second injunction. There is no established rule of exclusion which would deprive a court of jurisdiction to issue an injunction because of the issuance of an injunction between the same parties appertaining to the same subject-matter, but there is what may properly be termed a judicial comity on the subject. And even where it is a case of one court having refused to grant an injunction, while such refusal does not exclude another coordinate court or Judge from jurisdiction, yet the granting of the injunction by a second Judge may lead to complications and retaliatory action...."" 71) The issue before us is whether the judgment and order passed by the High Court in the writ petition filed by one of the legal representatives having attained finality in so far as the notification dated 11.12.1952 issued under the Evacuee Property Act , could have been re-agitated by the other legal heirs of late Mandal Buchaiah and whether the authorities under the Evacuee Property Act could have 55 gone beyond the Judgment and order passed by the Writ Court and whether the High Court was justified in the subsequent Writ Petition filed to have re-agitated the issue which had attained finality. 72) In the Writ Petition filed by Mandal Anjaiah, the Regional Settlement Commissioner and custodian of Evacuee Property, Bombay, was arrayed as one of the respondents. That only means, he was fully aware of the Judgment and order passed by the Writ Court. In the revision petition filed by the other legal representatives of late Mandal Buchaiah, he was also arrayed as one of the respondents. However, a perusal of the order passed by Deputy Custodian General does not clearly indicate whether it was brought to his notice the Judgment and order passed by the High Court, yet again, in the order by the Collector-cum-Deputy Custodian dated 28.5.1979, there is no reference to the Judgment and order passed by the High Court. However, in the order passed by Chief Settlement Commissioner of Evacuee Property, there is reference to the judgment of the High Court. The said authority while setting aside the order passed by Collector-cum-Deputy Custodian as nullity, the reliance is not placed on the judgment and order passed by the High Court. In the subsequent Writ Petition filed, the respondents therein, in their 56 Counter Affidavit had specifically contended that the notification dated 11.12.1952 has become final in view of the judgment and order passed by the High Court in Writ Petition No. 1051 of 1966 as also in Writ petition 7517 of 1983. The Division Bench of the High Court while dealing with this aspect, has observed in its order ""it is not correct to read the Judgment dated 14.6.1968 rendered in W.P. No. 1051 of 1966 that this Court had negatived the rights of the petitioners. A sentence here and there in a Judgment cannot be picked up in construing it. A Judgment has to be construed on reading and understanding as a whole and if so understood, the judgment in W.P. 1051 of 1966 is to the effect that in the writ petition, the rights of the parties cannot be adjudicated and more so in view of the fact that alternative remedy of appeal is available under the Act. By that, it cannot be assumed that this Court had upheld the notification issued under Section 7 of the Act"". 73) We do not agree with the reasoning and conclusion reached by the Division Bench of the High Court. We do not think that the decision of the court has been correctly read. However, we do agree with the learned Judges that the Judgment should be read as a whole and understood in the context and circumstances of the facts of that 57 case. In this context, it is worthwhile to recall the observations made by this court in the case of U.P. State Road Transport Corporation v. Asstt. Commissioner of Police (Traffic) Delhi [2009(3) SCC 634], wherein it is observed that ""a decision is an authority, it is trite for which it decides and not what can logically be deduced therefrom. This wholesome principle is equally applicable in the matter of construction of a judgment. A judgment is not to be construed as a Statute. It must be construed upon reading the same as a whole. For the said purpose, the attending circumstances may also be taken into consideration."" 74) At the cost of repetition, we once again intend to notice the judgment and order passed by the High Court in W.P. No. 1051 of 1966. The Court, while narrating the facts, specifically observes that what is challenged before it by the petitioner was the notification dated 11.12.1952 issued under Section 7 of the Evacuee Property Act declaring certain properties as evacuee properties. While dismissing the writ petition, the Court has observed that petitioner has failed to avail the alternate remedy of appeal provided under the Act and at the belated stage, he cannot question the correctness or otherwise of the notification dated 11.12.1952. Therefore, it may not be correct to say 58 that the court had rejected the writ petition only on the ground that the petitioner without availing the alternate remedy provided under the Act, could not have filed the writ petition. We hold that the writ petition was dismissed by the High Court not only on the ground that the petitioner had failed to avail the remedy under the Act, but also on the ground that the petitioner could not have questioned the notification dated 11.12.1952 at a belated stage. Therefore, in our view, the approach of the Division Bench of the High Court was not justified in entertaining a writ petition on the very issue, which had attained finality in an earlier proceeding. This view has nothing to do with the Principle of res judicata nor are we saying Principles of res judicata would apply in the facts and circumstances of this case. We are only holding that when a competent court refuses to entertain a challenge made to a notification issued on 11.12.1952 in a writ petition filed in the year 1966, the High Court could not have entertained the writ petition on the same cause of action at a belated stage in a writ petition filed in the year 1990. The course adopted by the High Court not only leads to confusion but also leads to inconvenience. We also hold that the Judgment and order of the High Court was binding on the authorities under the Evacuee Property Act 59 and, therefore, they could not have reagitated the correctness or otherwise of the notification dated 11.12.1952 issued under Section 7 of the Evacuee Property Act. 75) Shri. Ranjit Kumar, learned senior counsel, contends that the writ petition was filed by one of the co-owners of late Mandal Buchaiah and judgment and order passed would not bind the other parties. We cannot agree. It is a settled law that no co-owner has a definite right, title and interest in any particular item or portion thereof. On the other hand, he has right, title and interest in every part and parcel of the joint property or coparcenery under Hindu Law by all the coparceners. Our conclusion is fortified by the view expressed by this court in A. Viswanath Pillai and Others vs. The Special Tahsildar for Land Acquisition No.IV and Others (1991) 4 SCC 17), in which this Court observed: ""It is settled law that one of the co-owners can file a suit and recover the property against strangers and the decree would enure to all the co-owners. It is equally settled law that no co-owner has a definite right, title and interest in any particular item or a portion thereof. On the other hand he has right, title and interest in every part and parcel of the joint property or coparcenery under Hindu law by all the coparceners. In Kanta Goel v. B.P. Pathak (1977) 2 SCC 814, this Court upheld an application by one of the co-owners for eviction of a tenant for personal occupation of the co-owners as being maintainable. 60 The same view was reiterated in Sri Ram Pasricha v. Jagannath ( 1976) 4 SCC 184 and Pal Singh v. Sunder Singh ..."" ""....A co-owner is as much an owner of the entire property as a sole owner of the property. It is not correct to say that a co-owner's property was not its own. He owns several parts of the composite property alongwith others and it cannot be said that he is only a part owner or a fractional owner in the property. That position will undergo a change only when partition takes place and division was effected by metes and bounds. Therefore, a co-owner of the property is an owner of the property acquired but entitled to receive compensation pro rata."" 76) Re. Constructive Res judicata:- Learned counsel Shri. Mukund submits that the respondents herein for the first time in the writ petition filed in the year 1990 had raised a contention that the procedure prescribed under the Evacuee Property Act and the rules framed thereunder were not followed before notifying the lands in question as evacuee property. Though this ground was available, the same was not raised. Therefore, it is contended that a ground, though opened to be raised, but not raised in earlier writ petition, cannot be allowed to be raised in a subsequent writ petition. Sri Ranjit Kumar, learned senior counsel, would contend that the judgment and order in W.P. No. 1051 of 1966 was not dismissed on merits but only on the ground of delay and laches and therefore, 61 principles of constructive res judicata would not apply. Our attention is invited to the decision of this court in the case of Daya Rao Vs. State of U.P. (1962) 1 SCR 574 and in the case of Hosunak Singh Vs. Union of India (1979) 3 SCC 135. 77) In our view, this issue need not detain us for long. This Court in the case of Devilal Modi, Proprietor, M/s Daluram Pannalal Modi v. Sales Tax officer Ratlam & Ors. [AIR 1965 SC 1150], has observed that ""the rule of constructive res judicata that of a plea could have been taken by a party in a proceeding between him and his opponent, he would not be permitted to take that plea against the same party in a subsequent proceeding, which is based on the same cause of action, is founded on the same considerations of public policy. If the doctrine of constructive res judicata is not applied to writ proceedings, it would be open to the party to take proceedings one after another and urge new grounds every time, and that plainly is inconsistent with considerations of Public policy."" 78) In the present case, it is admitted fact that when the contesting respondents filed W.P. No. 1051 of 1966, the ground of non- compliance of statutory provision was very much available to them, 62 but for the reasons best known to them, they did not raise it as one of the grounds while challenging the notification dated 11.12.1952 issued under the Evacuee Property Act . In the subsequent writ petition filed in the year 1990, initially, they had not questioned the legality of the notification, but raised it by filing an application, which is no doubt true, allowed by the High Court. In our view, the High Court was not justified in permitting the petitioners therein to raise that ground and answer the same, since the same is hit by the principles analogous to constructive res judicata. 79) Re: Whether the High Court could have gone into the facts under its writ jurisdiction:- The learned counsel Shri Mukund contends that the High Court in exercise of its power under Article 226 of the Constitution of India ought not have gone into the disputed facts and render a finding on those facts. The learned counsel invites our attention to the observations made by this Court in Surya Dev Rai vs. Ramchander Rai and Others ( 2003) 6 SCC 675, Ranjit Singh vs. Ravi Prakash ( 2004) 3 SCC 682 and Karnataka State Industrial Investment and Development Corporation Ltd. vs. Cavalet India Ltd . and Others (2005) 4 SCC 456. Per contra, Shri Ranjit Kumar, learned senior counsel submits that since there is a bar for filing civil suit 63 under Section 28 and Section 48 of the Evacuee Property Act and Section 36 of the Displaced Persons Act, the High Court necessarily has to go into disputed question of facts. In aid of his submission, the learned senior counsel has relied on the decisions of this Court in the case of State of Orissa vs. Dr. Miss Binapani Dei and Ors. ( 1967) 2 SCR 625, Smt. Gunwant Kaur and Ors. vs. Municipal Committee, Bhatinda and Ors. (1969) 3 SCC 769, Om Prakash Vs. State of Haryana and others ( 1971) 3 SCC 792, Surya Dev Rai vs. Ram Chander Rai and Ors. (2003) 6 SCC 675 and ABL International Ltd. and Anr. Vs. Export Credit Guarantee Corporation of India Ltd. and Ors. (2004) 3 SCC 553. 80) The High Court in its writ jurisdiction, will not enquire into complicated questions of fact. The High Court also does not sit in appeal over the decision of an authority whose orders are challenged in the proceedings. The High Court can only see whether the authority concerned has acted with or without jurisdiction. The High Court can also act when there is an error of law apparent on the face of the record. The High Court can also interfere with such decision where there is no legal evidence before the authority concerned, or where the decision of the authority concerned is held to be perverse, 64 i.e., a decision which no reasonable man could have arrived at on the basis of materials available on record. Where an enquiry into complicated questions of fact is necessary before the right of aggrieved party to obtain relief claimed may be determined, the court may, in appropriate cases, decline to enter upon that enquiry, but the question is always one of discretion and not of jurisdiction of the court which may, in a proper case, enter upon a decision on questions of fact raised by the petitioner. 81) Before we advert to the settled legal position, we will notice the decisions on which reliance is placed by the learned counsel for the parties. 82) This Court in Surya Devi Rai 's case (supra), for parameters for the exercise of jurisdiction, held as under :- ""(3) Certiorari, under Article 226 of the Constitution, is issued for correcting gross errors of jurisdiction, i.e., when a subordinate court is found to have acted (i) without jurisdiction - by assuming jurisdiction where there exists none, or (ii) in excess of its jurisdiction - by overstepping or crossing the limits of jurisdiction, or (iii) acting in flagrant disregard of law or the rules or procedure or acting in violation of principles of natural justice where there is no procedure specified, and thereby occasioning failure of justice. 65 (4) Supervisory jurisdiction under Article 227 of the Constitution is exercised for keeping the subordinate courts within the bounds of their jurisdiction. When the subordinate Court has assumed a jurisdiction which it does not have or has failed to exercise a jurisdiction which it does have or the jurisdiction though available is being exercised by the Court in a manner not permitted by law and failure of justice or grave injustice has occasioned thereby, the High Court may step in to exercise its supervisory jurisdiction. (5) Be it a writ of certiorari or the exercise of supervisory jurisdiction, none is available to correct mere errors of fact or of law unless the following requirements are satisfied: (i) the error is manifest and apparent on the face of the proceedings such as when it is based on clear ignorance or utter disregard of the provisions of law, and (iii( a grave injustice or gross failure of justice has occasioned thereby."" (83) In Ranjeet Singh 's case (supra), this Court, while explaining the jurisdiction of the High Court in exercise of its power under Article 226 and 227 of the Constitution, held :- ""Feeling aggrieved by the judgment of the Appellate Court, the respondent preferred a writ petition in the/High Court of Judicature at Allahabad under Article 226 and alternatively under Article 227 of the Constitution. It was heard by a learned Single Judge of the High Court. The High Court has set aside the judgment of the Appellate Court and restored that of the Trial Court. A perusal of the judgment of the High Court shows that the High Court has clearly exceeded its 66 jurisdiction in setting aside the judgment of the Appellate Court. Though not specifically stated, the phraseology employed by the High Court in its judgment, goes to show that the High Court has exercised its certiorari jurisdiction for correcting the judgment of the Appellate Court."" (84) In Karnataka State Industrial Investment and Development Corporation Ltd. (supra), while explaining the jurisdiction of the High Court in exercising its jurisdiction under Article 226 of the Constitution, has stated :- ""The High Court while exercising its jurisdiction under Article 226 of the Constitution does not sit as an appellate authority over the acts and deeds of the financial corporation and seek to correct them. The Doctrine of fairness does not convert the writ courts into appellate authorities over administrative authorities."" (85) Shri Ranjit Kumar, per contra, has placed reliance on the observations made by this Court in the case of State of Orissa Vs. Dr. (Miss) Binapani Dei and others (1967) 2 SCR 625, has observed :- ""Under Article 226 of the Constitution the High Court is not precluded from entering upon a decision on questions of fact raised by the petition. Where an enquiry into complicated questions of fact arises in a petition under Article 226 of the Constitution before the right of an aggrieved party to obtain relief 67 claimed may be determined, the High Court may in appropriate cases decline to enter upon that enquiry and may refer the party claiming relief to a suit. But the question is one of discretion and not of jurisdiction of the Court."" (86) In Smt. Gunwant Kaur and others Vs. Municipal Committee, Bhatinda and others (1969) 3 SCC 769, this Court held as under :- ""The High Court, however, proceeded to dismiss the petition in limine. The High Court is not deprived of its jurisdiction to entertain a petition under Article 226 merely because in considering the petitioners right to relief questions of fact may fall to be determined. In a petition under Article 226 the High Court has jurisdiction to try issues both of fact and law. Exercise of the jurisdiction is, it is true, discretionary, but the discretion must be exercised on sound judicial principles. When the petition raises questions of fact of a complex nature, which may for their determination require oral evidence to be taken, and on that account the High Court is of the view that the dispute may not appropriately be tried in a writ petition, the High Court may decline to try a petition."" (87) In Om Prakash Vs. State of Haryana and others (1971) 3 SCC 792, this Court observed :- ""The two judgments referred to by the High Court proceeded on the ground that the High Court would not in deciding a petition for a writ under Article 226 of the Constitution enter upon disputed questions of fact. But whether in the present case there are disputed questions of fact of such complexity as would 68 render it inappropriate to try in hearing a writ petition is a matter which has never been decided. There is no rule that the High Court will not try issues of fact in a writ petition. In each case the court has to consider whether the party seeking relief has an alternative remedy which is equally efficacious by a suit, whether refusal to grant relief in a writ petition may amount to denying relief, whether the claim is based substantially upon consideration of evidence oral and documentary of a complicated nature and whether the case is otherwise fit for trial in exercise of the jurisdiction to issue high prerogative writs."" (88) In ABL International Ltd. and another Vs. Export Credit Guarantee Corporation of India Ltd. and others (2004) 3 SCC 553, this Court has held :- ""Therefore, it is clear from the above enunciation of law that merely because one of the parties to the litigation raises a dispute in regard to the facts of the case, the court entertaining such petition under Article 226 of the Constitution is not always bound to relegate the parties to a suit. In the above case of Smt. Gunwant Kaur (supra), this Court even went to the extent of holding that in a writ petition, if facts required, even oral evidence can be taken. This clearly shows that in an appropriate case, the writ court has the jurisdiction to entertain a writ petition involving disputed questions of fact and there is no absolute bar for entertaining a writ petition even if the same arises out of a contractual obligation and or involves some disputed questions of fact."" 69 (89) In Custodian of Evacuee Property Punjab and others Vs. Jafran Begum (1967) 3 SCR 736, this Court held :- ""It may be added that the only question to be decided under s. 7 is whether the property is evacuee property or not and the jurisdiction of the Custodian to decide this question does not depend upon any finding on a collateral fact. Therefore there is no scope for the application of that line of cases where it has been held that where the jurisdiction of a tribunal of limited jurisdiction depends upon the first finding certain state of facts, it cannot give itself jurisdiction on a wrong finding of that state of fact. Here under s. 7 the Custodian has to decide whether certain property is or is not evacuee property and his jurisdiction does not depend upon any collateral fact being decided as a condition precedent to his assuming jurisdiction. In these circumstances, s. 46 is a complete bar to the jurisdiction of civil or revenue courts in any matter which can be decided under s. 7 . This conclusion is reinforced by the provision contained in s. 4(1) of the Act which provides that the Act overrides other laws and would thus override s. 9 of the Code of Civil Procedure on a combined reading of Sections 4 , 28 and 46 . But as we have said already, s. 46 or s. 28 cannot bar the jurisdiction of the High Court Art. 226 of the Constitution, for that is a power conferred on the High Court under the Constitution."" (90) We are of the view that the High Court has not committed an error while entertaining a writ petition filed under Article 226 and 227 of the Constitution, wherein the proceedings under Section 7 of the Evacuee Property Act was questioned. We say so for the reason that 70 under the Evacuee Property Act , there is specific bar for the civil court to adjudicate on the issue whether certain property is or is not evacuee property. This issue can be decided only by the custodian under the Act. Any person aggrieved by the findings of the custodian can avail the other remedies provided under the Act. The findings and the conclusion reached by the authorities under the Act in an appropriate case can be questioned in a petition filed under Article 226 of the Constitution even it involves disputed questions of facts. This issue, in our view, is no more res integra in view of three Judge Bench decision of this Court in Jafran Begum 's case (supra). (91) Re : Whether the lands in question are evacuee property under Evacuee Property Act : Shri Mukund, learned counsel for the appellants, submits that the disputed lands belong to late Rahim Baksh Khan and after issuing notice to the sons of late Rahim Baksh Khan and after following the procedure prescribed under the Evacuee Property Act and the rules framed thereunder, the lands were notified as evacuee property by issuing notification dated 11.12.1952. Learned counsel further submitted that late Rahim Baksh Khan had the money decree against 71 late Mandal Buchaiah and in execution of the court decree, Rahim Baksh Khan became the owner of the property and his name had been recorded in the Khatra Khatauni as owner of the said lands. The entry so made in the revenue records was not questioned by anybody including late Mandal Buchaiah during his lifetime. It is further submitted that the records of the execution petition was not traceable since the matter is 60 years old and they have also not been placed on record by the contesting respondents. Therefore, in view of the entries made in the Revenue records, late Rahim Baksh Khan and his legal representatives were in possession of the lands under dispute. It is also submitted that the contesting respondents took the said lands on Ek saala lease from the Government in the year 1952 to 1955 and only in the year 1956, they made representation for the redressal of their grievance before the authorities under the Evacuee Property Act and since those representations did not yield any result, they approached the High Court only in the year 1966 only questioning the action of Tahsildar who had proposed to auction of the lands for grant of Ek saala lease. However, Shri Ranjit Kumar would submit that late Rahim Baksh Khan never became the owner of the lands since he did not execute the money decree that he had 72 obtained from a civil court. The learned senior counsel by placing reliance on various provisions of the Evacuee Property Act and the rules framed thereunder, submits that since procedure prescribed under the Evacuee Property Act is not followed, the authorities under the Act could not have declared the disputed lands as evacuee property. It is submitted that the order passed under Section 7 of the Evacuee Property Act is manifestly illegal and the illegality cannot be perpetuated against the contesting respondents since they are owners and in continuous possession of the property. The learned senior counsel also submits that except the notification issued under Section 7 of the Act, no other document such as order passed under the Act after notice to the persons interested in the lands is produced by the State Government in whose custody the records of the proceedings were available. Therefore, Deputy Custodian General was justified in setting aside the declaration made under Section 7 of the Evacuee Property Act which order has merged with the impuged judgment and order of the High Court. However, learned counsel for the State of Andhra Pradesh by referring to their counter affidavit filed in the writ petition before the High Court submits that the authority under the Act before issuing notification under Section 7 of the Evacuee Property 73 Act, the procedure prescribed therein had been followed and this assertion had not been denied by the respondents by filing their reply affidavit and since no denial of the factual assertion made by the State Government, the only inference that can be drawn is that the proper procedure prescribed under the Act had been followed before issuing the notification under the Evacuee Property Act . (92) Admittedly, before the High Court, parties to the lis had not produced any records. Petitioners therein claimed that they were not dispossessed from the lands in dispute pursuant to any money decree by late Rahim Baksh Khan or his legal representatives. It is the stand of the appellants and also the State Government that the name of late Rahim Baksh Khan had been recorded in the Khatra Khatauni and the authorities under the Evacuee Property Act after issuing notices to the legal representatives of late Rahim Baksh Khan and also the public notice, the notification under Section 7 of the Act was issued and gazetted. Since the records are of the year 1952, neither the State Government nor the contesting respondents could produce any records or documents in support of their claim. However, based on the affidavits filed by the petitioner, the High Court proceeds to hold that they were not dispossessed from their lands in accordance with 74 law. This reasoning of the learned Judges is firstly difficult to comprehend and secondly, difficult to accept. It is the specific case of the appellants, by placing reliance on the revenue records, that the name of late Rahim Baksh Khan found a place in the revenue records prior to issuance of the notification dated 11.12.1952 under the Evacuee Property Act and, thereafter, the name of the custodian is shown as the owner of the lands. The burden of proof was on the petitioners therein to prove their title, right and interest in the property. It looks again very strange to us that the High Court, in the absence of any records of the year 1952, proceeds to determine that the official respondents had not followed the mandatory requirement of the provisions of the Evacuee Property Act and rules framed thereunder before declaring the disputed lands as evacuee property. It also looks odd and queer to us that the High Court, in the absence of any records of the civil court and the executing court, proceeds to arrive at a definite finding that the sale of property had not taken place. Pursuant to the money decree passed, the executing court had not auctioned disputed lands and late Rahim Baksh Khan became the owner of the lands, though it concedes that the above facts have to be proved with reference to the records and there cannot be oral evidence 75 in this regard. To say the least, it was highly inappropriate for the High Court to have proceeded to determine whether any notice was issued to late Mandal Buchaiah before notifying the property as evacuee property without there being any material nor the documents and records by relying only on the procedure prescribed under the Act and the rules thereunder, even after noticing that both the parties have not produced any records, since the records are old and not traceable. In view of the above, we are of the opinion, the High Court was wholly incorrect when it arrives at a finding that there is manifest illegality while issuing notification under Section 7 of the Evacuee Property Act. For the very same reason, we cannot also accept the findings and the conclusion reached by the Collector-cum-Deputy Custodian in his order dated 28.05.1979. (93) The High Court in the impugned Judgment, also gives a finding that the authorities under the Act have violated the principles of natural justice in not issuing notice to the owners of the lands in dispute before taking any action under the Act. We are of the view that whether any notice under the Act was issued or not, can only be decided with reference to the records. Such records were neither available nor any material was produced by the petitioners in support 76 of their assertion made in the writ petition. Though, this assertion was denied by the respondents in their counter affidavit filed before the Court, this issue is answered by the High Court in favour of the petitioners. We disagree with the findings and conclusion reached by the High Court in this regard. (94) Re : Effect of acquisition and Distribution of the Evacuee Propety under the Displaced Persons (Compensation and Rehabilitation) Act, 1954 . The contention of the learned counsel Shri Mukund is that once the notification under Section 12 of the Displaced Property Act is issued and the lands are acquired for re-distribution, no proceedings can lie under the Evacuee Property Act . Per contra, learned senior counsel Shri Ranjit Kumar would submit this can be so, provided notification issued under Evacuee Property Act is valid and legal. Shri Mukund, learned counsel has placed reliance on Major Gopal Singh and Others. vs. Custodian, Evacuee Property, Punjab (1962) 1 SCR 328, Basant Ram vs. Union of India (1962) Supp. 2 SCR 733 and Dafedar Niranjan Singh and Another vs. Custodian, Evacuee Property (Pb .) and Another (1962) 1 SCR 214. 77 (95) In Major Gopal Singh 's case, this Court held that ""the power of the Custodian under the Administration of Evacuee Property Act, 1950 , to allot any property to a person or to cancel an allotment existing in favour of a person rests on the fact that the property vests in him. But the consequence of the publication of the notification by the Central Government under Section 12(1) of the Displaced Persons (Compensation and Rehabilitation) Act with regard to any property or a class of property would be to divest the custodian completely of his right in the property flowing from Section 8 of the Administration of the Evacuee Property Act, 1950 and vest that property in the Central Government."" (96) In Basant Ram's case, this Court held that ""It is not in dispute that the evacuee property in these two villages was notified under Section 12(1) of the Act on March 24, 1955. The consequence of that notification is that all rights, title and interest of the evacuee in the property ceased with the result that the property no longer remained evacuee property. Once, therefore, the property ceased to be evacuee property, it cannot be dealt with under Central Act No. XXXII of 1950 or the Rules framed thereunder."" 78 (97) Shri Ranjit Kumar's submission is that the proceedings under the 1954 Act only happen if the proceedings under the 1950 Act are valid. If the proceedings under 1950 Act is invalid, the 1954 Act does not come into operation. To demonstrate that, the proceedings under the Evacuee Property Act is invalid for want of notice on the person/persons who would be effected by an order under the Act, the learned senior counsel has relied on the observations made by the High Court of Bombay in the case of Abdul Majid Hazi Mohammed vs. P.R. Nayak (AIR 1951 Bombay 440), wherein the Court has observed that mode of service of notice under Section 7 of Act read with Rule 25 of the Rules, contents of the notice and the nature of the order that requires to be passed by the Custodian under the Evacuee Property Act . (98) In Dr. Zafar Ali Shah and Others vs. The Assistant Custodian of Evacuee Property [1962] 1 SCR 749, wherein this Court has observed that Section 12 of Displaced Persons Act, 1954 only affects the rights of Evacuee in his property. The notification made under that Section did not have the effect of extinguishing the petitioners' rights in the houses as they had never been declared evacuees. 79 (99) In Ebrahim Aboobaker vs. Tek Chand Dolwani [1953] SCR 691, wherein the Court has stated that it is well established and not disputed that no property of any person can be declared to be evacuee property unless that person had first been given a notice under Section 7 of the Act. (100) In Nasir Ahmed vs. Assistant Custodian General, Evacuee Property, U.P. Lucknow and Another [1980] 3 SCR 248, it is held, that Section 7 of the Evacuee Property Act required the custodian to form an opinion that the property in question was evacuee property within the meaning of the Act before any action under that Section was taken. Under Rule 6 of the Administration of Evacuee Property (Central) Rules, 1950, the custodian had to be satisfied from information in his possession or otherwise that the property was prima-facie evacuee property before a notice was issued. (101) To answer this issue, we are required to notice certain provisions of both the Acts to arrive at a finding whether both the Acts operate independent of each other or whether they are complimentary and the action of one Act has some bearing on the other Act which we are concerned in these appeals. 80 (102) The Evacuee Property Act was mainly intended to provide for the administration of evacuee property. The Act is primarily concerned with evacuee property and not the person who is evacuee. The procedure prescribed to declare a particular property as an evacuee property is mandatory and they are to be complied with by the authorities notified under the Act and the Rules framed thereunder. The Act is a complete code itself in the matter of dealing with evacuee property. The question whether any property or right or interest in any property is or is not evacuee property can be adjudicated only by the custodian and not the civil courts. Section 7 of the Act confers the power upon the custodian to declare certain property as evacuee property. Sub-section (1) provides that where the custodian is of the opinion that any property is evacuee property within the meaning of Section 2(f) of the Evacuee Property Act, then he may pass an order declaring such property to be evacuee property, provided he causes notice thereof to be given in such manner as may be prescribed to the persons interested and he holds such inquiry into matter as the circumstances of the case permit. Section 8(1) of the Act envisages that once the property has been declared to be evacuee property under Section 7 , that property must be deemed to have 81 vested in the custodian for the State. Section 8(4) contemplates a situation even where any evacuee property has vested in the custodian, any person is in possession thereof shall be deemed to be holding it on behalf of the custodian. Section 9 gives the power to the custodian to take possession of evacuee property which is vested in him. Section 24 confers a right of appeal against the orders passed under Section 7 , 40 and 48 of the Act. Section 27 confers on the Custodian General the power of revision to revise the orders under the Act either `suo-moto' or on an application filed by the aggrieved person. Section 28 bars the jurisdiction of the civil courts from entertaining suits relating to matters within the exclusive jurisdiction of the custodian. But Section 28 or Section 46 of the Act cannot bar jurisdiction of the High Court under Article 226 of the Constitution. The question whether evacuee property has been vested in custodian or not is a question of fact and the same cannot be interfered with except in exceptional circumstances which would include violation of principles of natural justice before notifying a property an evacuee property. 82 (103) The Displaced Persons Act provides for payment of compensation and rehabilitation grants to displaced persons and for matters connected therewith. The Sections which require to be noticed for the purpose of this case are Sections 12 and 24 of the Displaced Persons Act. Section 12 of the Act authorizes the Central Government to acquire evacuee property for rehabilitation of the displaced persons. Section 24 of the Act vests power in the Chief Settlement Commissioner to set aside or vary any order passed by any of the officers named in that sub-section at any time, if the Chief Settlement Commissioner is not satisfied about the legality or propriety of such order. (104) To appreciate and resolve the controversy raised in these appeals, it would be useful to extract the relevant Section 12 which reads as under: ""12. Power to acquire evacuee property for rehabilitation of displaced persons--(1) If the Central Government is of opinion that it is necessary to acquire any evacuee property for a public purpose, being a purpose connected with the relief and rehabilitation of displaced persons, including payment of compensation to such persons, the Central Government may at any time acquire such evacuee property by publishing in the Official Gazette a notification to the effect that the 83 Central Government has decided to acquire such evacuee property in pursuance of this section. (2) On the publication of a notification under sub-section (1), the right, title and interest of any evacuee in the evacuee property specified in the notification shall, on and from the beginning of the date on which the notification is so published, be extinguished and the evacuee property shall vest absolutely in the Central Government free from all encumbrances. (3) It shall be lawful for the Central Government, if it so considers necessary, to issue from time to time the notification referred to in sub-section (1) in respect of-- (a) all evacuee property generally; or (b) any class of evacuee property; or (c) all evacuee property situated in a specified area; or (d) any particular evacuee property. (4) All evacuee property acquired under this Section shall form part of the compensation pool."" (105) At the cost of repetition, let us once again notice the submissions made by learned counsel for the parties. Shri Mukund, learned counsel for the appellant submits that once the notification is issued under Section 12 of the Displaced Property Act, the evacuee property notified under the Evacuee Property Act no more exists and therefore, the authorities under the Evacuee Property Act could not 84 have passed the order dated 25.09.1970 and 28.05.1979 and, therefore, Chief Settlement Commissioner of Displaced Persons Act was justified in passing the order dated 11.05.1983. The learned senior counsel Shri Ranjit Kumar would submit that since there was irregularity in declaring the disputed lands as evacuee property, the Deputy Custodian General was justified in setting aside the notification declaring the disputed land as evacuee property. (106) Section 12 of the Act authorizes the Central Government to acquire the evacuee property if it so desires and on such acquisition the property shall vest absolutely in the Central Government free from all encumbrances. The pre-requisite for acquiring property under Section 12 is that it must be evacuee property as defined under Section 2 (f) of the Act. The consequence of issuing notification under Section 12 of the Act would denude the powers of the Custodian under Evacuee Property Act . As soon as the notification is published, property ceases to be evacuee property. This Court in the case of Haji Siddik Haji Umar and Others. Vs. Union of India (1983) 1 SCC 408, has held ""that the publication of a notification under Section 12 extinguishes the right, title or interest of the evacuee in the evacuee properties. By virtue of Section 12(2) they vest absolutely in 85 the Central Government free from all encumbrances. The only relief available to an evacuee is compensation in accordance with such principles and in such manner as may be agreed upon between the two countries. The jurisdiction of the Court to consider any orders passed by the Custodian or any action taken by him would not be barred if the orders passed or the action taken was without jurisdiction. But, if a party succeeds in establishing that the action taken or the orders passed were outside the purview of the Act, then, those would not be the orders passed under the Act."" (107) While answering the issue whether the `disputed lands' is evacuee property or not, we have held that the notification issued under Section 7 of the Evacuee Property Act is valid in law and, therefore, one and the only conclusion that can be reached on this issue is, in the facts and circumstances of the case, in view of the notification issued by the Central Govt. under Section 12 of the Displaced Persons Act, for the `disputed lands' had vested in the Central Govt. and thereby had lost the status of evacuee property. (108) Shri Ranjit Kumar also submitted that the order passed by the Chief Settlement Commissioner is one without jurisdiction, since the 86 said authority can exercise his power of revision to set a side any order passed by any of the officers named in that Section. Since Deputy Custodian General is not one of those officers named in that sub-section, he could not have exercised his power of revision against an order passed by Deputy Custodian General dated 28.05.1979. (109) Section 24 of the Act speaks of power of revision of the Chief Settlement Commissioner. The said Section reads :- ""Power of revision of the Chief Settlement Commissioner - (1) The Chief Settlement Commissioner may at any time call for the record of any proceeding under this Act in which a Settlement Officer, an Assistant Settlement Officer, an Assistant Settlement Commissioner, an Additional Settlement Commissi oner, a Settlement Commissioner, a Managing officer or a managing corporation has passed an order for the purpose of satisfying himself as to the legality or propriety of any such order and may pass such order in relation thereto as he thinks fit."" (110) Section 24 of the Act gives power of revision to Chief Settlement Commissioner either on his motion or an application made to him to call for the record of any proceeding under the Act in order to satisfy himself as to legality or propriety of any order passed therein and to pass such order in relation thereto as he thinks fit. The Section also provides that the said powers can be used in 87 relation to the orders passed by Settlement Commissioner, an Assistant Settlement Commissioner, an Additional Settlement Commissioner, a Settlement Commissioner, a Managing officer or a managing corporation. A bare reading of the Section shows that the Chief Settlement Commissioner can revise the order if in his opinion that the orders passed by the officers named in the Section are either illegal or improper. In the instant case, the Chief Settlement Commissioner has invoked his revisional powers at the request of the allottees/displaced persons to revise the proceedings and the order passed by the Collector-cum-Deputy Custodian under the provisions of the Evacuee Property Act dated 28.05.1979. In view of the plain language of the Section, there cannot be two views. In our view, what the Chief Settlement Commissioner can do is only to revise the orders passed by those officers who are notified in the Section itself and not of the officers under the provisions of the Evacuee Property Act , if the orders passed by the named officers in this Section is either illegal or improper. To this extent, we are in agreement with the submission made by the learned senior counsel Shri Ranjit Kumar. Therefore, the orders passed by the Chief Settlement Commissioner in exercise of his 88 revisional powers under the Displaced Persons Act is without jurisdiction and non-est in law. (111) To sum up, our conclusions are : (I) The High Court ought not to have entertained and granted relief to the writ petitioner/contesting respondents, since there was inordinate and unexplained delay in approaching the court. (II) The Judgment and order of the High Court in W.P. No. 1061 of 1966 having attained finality was binding on the authorities under the Evacuee Property Act and the High Court ought not to have permitted the writ petitioners/contesting respondents herein to re-agitate the correctness or otherwise of the notification dated 11.12.1952 in the subsequent writ petition. (III) A subsequent writ petition was not maintainable in respect of an issue concluded between the parties in the earlier writ petition. 89 (IV) In view of the specific bar under Section 46 of the Evacuee Property Act, writ petition filed by the contesting respondents before the High Court was maintainable. (V) Since we have taken exception to the orders passed by the Collector-cum-Deputy Custodian and the Judgment and order passed by the High Court in W.P. No. 17222 of 1990, we hold notification dated 11.12.1952 is valid in law. (VI) Since the notification issued under Section 7 of the Act is valid in law, the evacuee property acquired by the Central Govt. under Section 12 of the Displaced Persons Act ceases to be evacuee property and becomes the property of the Central Govt. (VII) In view of the clear language employed in Section 24 of the Act, the Chief Settlement Commissioner had no jurisdiction to revise the order passed by the Collector-cum-Deputy Custodian under the Evacuee Property Act . 90 (112) In view of the above discussion, the appeals are allowed. The Judgment and order passed by the High Court in W.P. 17222 of 1990 dated 27.04.2000 is set aside. Costs are made easy. ..............................J. [ D.K.

Raveendran REPORTABLE IN THE SUPREME COURT OF INDIA CIVIL APPELLATE JURISDICTION CIVIL APPEAL NO.4269 ___ OF 2011 (Arising out of SLP(C) No.16371 of 2008) Videocon Industries Limited ........Appellant Versus Union of India and another ........Respondents J U D G M E N T G.S. Singhvi, J. 1. Leave granted. 2. Whether the Delhi High Court could entertain the petition filed by the respondents under Section 9 of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 (for short, ""the Act"") for grant of a declaration that Kuala Lumpur (Malaysia) is contractual and juridical seat of arbitration and for issue of a direction to the arbitral tribunal to continue the hearing at Kuala Lumpur in 2 terms of clause 34 of Production Sharing Contract (PSC) is the question which arises for consideration in this appeal. 3. Respondent No.1 - Government of India owns petroleum resources within the area of India's territorial waters and exclusive economic zones. Respondent No.2 is an arm of the Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Gas. On 28.10.1994, a PSC was executed between respondent No.1 on the one hand and a consortium of four companies consisting of Oil and Natural Gas Corporation Limited, Videocon Petroleum Limited, Command Petroleum (India) Private Limited and Ravva Oil (Singapore) Private Limited (hereinafter referred to as ""the Contractor"") in terms of which the latter was granted an exploration licence and mining lease to explore and produce the hydro carbon resources owned by respondent No.1. Subsequently, Cairn Energy U.K. was substituted in place of Command Petroleum (India) Private Limited and the name of the Videocon Petroleum Limited was changed to Petrocon India Limited, which merged the appellant - Videocon Industries Limited. For the sake of convenience, the relevant clauses of Articles 33 , 34 and 35 of the PSC are extracted below: ""33.1 Indian Law to Govern Subject to the provisions of Article 34.12 , this Contract shall be governed and interpreted in accordance with the laws of India. 3 33.2 Laws of India Not to be Contravened Subject to Article 17.1 nothing in this Contract shall entitle the Contractor to exercise the rights, privileges and powers conferred upon it by this Contract in a manner which will contravene the laws of India. 34.3 Unresolved Disputes Subject to the provisions of this Contract, the Parties agree that any matter, unresolved dispute, difference or claim which cannot be agreed or settled amicably within twenty one (21) days may be submitted to a sole expert (where Article 34.2 applies) or otherwise to an arbitral tribunal for final decision as hereinafter provided. 34.12. Venue and Law of Arbitration Agreement The venue of sole expert, conciliation or arbitration proceedings pursuant to this Article, unless the Parties otherwise agree, shall be Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, and shall be conducted in the English language. Insofar as practicable, the Parties shall continue to implement the terms of this Contract notwithstanding the initiation of arbitral proceedings and any pending claim or dispute. Notwithstanding the provisions of Article 33.1 , the arbitration agreement contained in this Article 34 shall be governed by the laws of England. 35.2 Amendment This Contract shall not be amended, modified, varied or supplemented in any respect except by an instrument in writing signed by all the Parties, which shall state the date upon which the amendment or modification shall become effective."" 4. In 2000, disputes arose between the respondents and the contractor with respect to correctness of certain cost recoveries and profit. Since the 4 parties could not resolve their disputes amicably, the same were referred to the arbitral tribunal under clause 34.3 of the PSC. The arbitral tribunal fixed 28.3.2003 as the date of hearing at Kuala Lumpur (Malaysia), but due to outbreak of epidemic SARS, the arbitral tribunal shifted the venue of its sittings to Amsterdam in the first instance and, thereafter, to London. In its meeting held on 29.6.2003 at Amsterdam, the arbitral tribunal issued various directions in Arbitration Case No.1 of 2003. On the next day, the arbitral tribunal issued similar directions in Arbitration Case Nos.2 and 3 of 2003. On 19.8.2003, the arbitral tribunal issued revised time schedule for filing of the statement of claim, reply and counter claim, reply to counter claim, documents, affidavit of admission and denial of documents in Arbitration Case No.3 of 2003 and fixed the case for further proceedings to be held at London on 12.12.2003. By another order dated 30.10.2003, the arbitral tribunal directed that the hearing of the application filed by the claimants for taking on record the supplementary claim will take place at London on 15.11.2003, on which date, the following order was passed in Arbitration Case No.3 of 2003: ""By consent of parties, seat of the Arbitration is shifted to London. Parties will deposit Rs.25,000 each as administrative cost with the Presiding Arbitrator."" 5 5. Thereafter, the following proceedings were held by the arbitral tribunal at London: (i) 6.2.2004 - Interim Award pronounced in Case No.1 of 2003 pronounced. (ii) 7.2.2004 - proceedings held in Arbitration Case No.2 of 2003. (iii) 17.3.2004 - Case No.2 of 2003 fixed for 13-19.5.2004 for final arguments. (iv) 17.3.2004 - Case No.3 of 2003 fixed for recording of evidence from 3.6.2004 to 9.6.2004. (v) 17.3.2004 - Case No.3 of 2003 fixed for arguments from 20-26.7.2004. (vi) 27.3.2004 - final arguments rescheduled to 16-20.5.2004 in Case No.2 of 2003. (vii) 25.11.2004 - Arbitral Tribunal declared that it will pass award in Case No.2 of 2003 and further partial award in Case No.1 of 2003. (viii) 3.2.2005 - Case No.2 of 2003 fixed for 25-26.2.2005 for hearing on the application for clarification filed on behalf of the Government of India. (ix) 12.3.2005 - The Tribunal declared that it will finalise the award in Case No.3 of 2003 and cross-objections in Case No.1 of 2003. (x) 31.3.2005 - Partial award passed in Case No.3 of 2003. 6. Respondent No.1 challenged partial award dated 31.3.2005 by filing a petition in the High Court of Malaysia at Kuala Lumpur. On being noticed, the appellant questioned the maintainability of the case before the High 6 Court of Malaysia by contending that in view of clause 34.12 of the PSC only the English Courts have the jurisdiction to entertain any challenge to the award. 7. After filing the petition before the High Court of Malaysia, the respondents made a request to the tribunal to conduct the remaining arbitral proceedings at Kuala Lumpur, but their request was rejected vide order dated 20.4.2006 and it was declared that the remaining arbitral proceedings will be held in London. 8. At that stage, the respondents filed OMP No.255 of 2006 under Section 9 of the Act in Delhi High Court for stay of the arbitral proceedings. They filed another OMP No.329 of 2006 questioning award dated 31.3.2005 on the issue of exchange rate. The appellant objected to the maintainability of OMP No.255 of 2006 and pleaded that the Courts in India do not have the jurisdiction to entertain challenge to the arbitral award. The learned Single Judge of the Delhi High Court overruled the objection of the appellant and held that the said High Court has the jurisdiction to entertain the petition filed under Section 9 of the Act. The learned Single Judge extensively referred to the judgment of this Court in Bhatia International v. Bulk Trading S.A. (2002) 4 SCC 105 and observed: ""The ratio of Bhatia International, in my understanding, is that the provisions of Part-I of the Indian Arbitration Act 7 would apply to international commercial arbitrations held outside India, unless the parties by agreement express or implied, exclude all or any of its provisions. It is noteworthy that the respondent, while challenging the jurisdiction of this Court to entertain the present petition, has not disputed the applicability of Part I of the Indian Arbitration Act to international commercial arbitrations held outside India. It is not the case of the respondent that section 9 of the Indian Arbitrations Act does not apply to international commercial arbitrations held outside India. What, in fact, learned senior counsel for the respondent has sought to contend before this Court is that the parties herein, by adopting the English Law as the proper law governing the arbitration agreement, have expressly excluded the applicability of the Indian Arbitration Act, and consequently, this Court has no jurisdiction to entertain the present petition. This contention of the respondent has been resisted by learned senior counsel for the petitioner on the ground that English law governs the substantive aspects of the arbitration agreement, whilst the procedural aspect thereof is governed by the curial law, that is, the procedural law of the country where the seat of arbitration is. It is thus contended by learned senior counsel for the petitioner that the juridical seat of arbitration being in Kuala Lumpur, it is the Malaysian laws that would govern the conduct of the arbitral proceedings. Learned senior counsel for the respondent has countervailed the said averment of the petitioner by submitting that London, and not, Kuala Lumpur is the `designated seat' of arbitration in view of the order dated 15.11.2003 passed by the Arbitral Tribunal whereby the Arbitral Tribunal recorded the consent of the parties and shifted the seat of arbitration to London. In view of the petitioner having already conceded to London as the juridical seat of arbitration, it is thus contended by learned counsel for the respondent that the petitioner cannot know insist on Kuala Lumpur being the seat of arbitration. The averments made by the respondent, without prejudice to the veracity thereof, entail an examination on merit and thus cannot be accepted at this preliminary stage. Whether the Courts at Kuala Lumpur or London have the jurisdiction to decide upon the seat of arbitration squarely hinges on the 8 procedural law governing the arbitration agreement. However, in a peculiar situation such as the present one where the governing procedural law is yet to be determined, I am of the view that a question regarding the seat of arbitration can be best decided by the Court to which the parties or to which the dispute is most closely connected. It is important to recall that in the instant case the parties have expressly stated in Article 33.1 of the PSC that the laws applicable to the contract would be the laws in force in India and that the ""Contract shall be governed and interpreted in accordance with the laws of India"". These words are wide enough to engulf every question arising under the contract including the disputes between the parties and the mode of settlement. It was in India that the PSC was executed. The form of the PSC is closely related to the system of law in India. It is also apparent that the PSC is to be performed in India with the aid of Indian workmen whose conditions of service are regulated by Indian laws. Moreover, whilst the petitioner is an important portfolio of the Government of India, the respondent is also a company incorporated under the Indian laws. The contract has in every respect the closest and most real connection with the Indian system of law and it is by that law that the parties have expressly evinced their intention to be bound in all respects. The arbitration agreement is contained in one of the clauses of the contract, and not in a separate agreement. In the absence of any indication to the contrary, the governing law of the contract or the ""proper law"" (in the words of Dicey) of the contract being Indian law, it is that system of law which must necessarily govern matters concerning arbitration, although in certain respects the law of the place of arbitration may have its relevance in regard to procedural matters. There is no gainsay that the Courts observe extreme circumspection whilst affording relief under section 9 of the Indian Arbitration Act, lest the annals of party autonomy and sanctity of the arbitral tribunal - the hallmarks of any arbitration - are jeopardized. It is to be appreciated that the object underlying the grant of interim measures under section 9 of the Indian Arbitration Act is to facilitate and sub serve any ongoing arbitral proceedings. 9 It is much apparent that the disparate stands taken by both parties qua the seat of arbitration has resulted in a veritable impasse in the arbitral proceedings in the present case. The petitioner has brought to our notice that the proceedings initiated by it at the High Court Kuala Lumpur challenging the Partial award have been virtually brought to a standstill owing the objections raised by the respondent on grounds of jurisdiction. The petitioner has already expressed its dissidence about the English Court deciding the question of seat of arbitration for the reason that for the English Court to assume jurisdiction, it is the place of arbitration which is the relevant factor. In such a situation, of the Indian Court does not adjudicate upon the present petition, the arbitral proceedings between the parties will invariably end in a stalemate. This, I am afraid, would not only be inimical to the interests of the parties but also affront to section 9 of the Indian Arbitration, the underlying object whereof is to sub serve and facilitate arbitral proceedings."" 9. Shri R.F. Nariman, learned senior counsel appearing for the appellant argued that the impugned order is liable to be set aside because the learned Single Judge misconstrued and misapplied the judgment of this Court in Bhatia International v. Bulk Trading S.A. (supra) and erroneously held that the Delhi High Court has jurisdiction to decide O.M.P. No.255 of 2006. Learned counsel further argued that the learned Single Judge failed to appreciate that the reliefs prayed for in O.M.P. No.255 of 2006 could not have been granted on an application filed under Section 9 of the Act because stay of arbitral proceedings is beyond the scope of that section. Learned senior counsel emphasized that Section 5 of the Act expressly bars intervention of the Courts except in matters expressly provided for in the Act 10 and, therefore, even if the petition filed by the respondents under Section 9 could be treated as maintainable, the High Court did not have jurisdiction over the arbitration proceedings because the same are governed by the laws of England. Shri Nariman then argued that after having expressly consented to the shifting of the seat of arbitration from Kuala Lumpur to Amsterdam in the first instance and effectively taken part in the proceedings held at London till 31.3.2005, respondent No.1 is estopped from claiming that the seat of arbitration continues to be at Kuala Lumpur. Learned senior counsel submitted that the learned Single Judge was not justified in rejecting objection to the maintainability of the petitions filed by respondent No.1 in the Delhi High Court merely because the appellant had earlier filed O.M.P. No.179 of 2003 before the High Court. He submitted that the doctrine of waiver and acquiescence cannot be pressed into service for deciding the issue relating to jurisdiction of the Delhi High Court to entertain the petition filed under Section 9 of the Act. Shri Nariman further submitted that if respondent No.1 felt aggrieved against partial award it could have filed petition under Sections 67 and 68 of the English Arbitration Act, 1996. 10. Shri Gopal Subramaniam, learned Solicitor General submitted that as per the arbitration agreement which is binding on all the parties to the contract, a conscious decision was taken by them that Kuala Lumpur will be the seat of any intended arbitration, Indian law as the law of contract and 11 English law as the law of arbitration and the mere fact that the arbitration was held outside Kuala Lumpur due to the outbreak of epidemic SARS, the venue of arbitration cannot be said to have been changed from Kuala Lumpur to London. Learned Solicitor General emphasised that once Kuala Lumpur was decided as the venue of arbitration by written agreement, the same could not have been changed except by amending the written agreement as provided in clause 35.2 of the PSC. He then argued that the arbitral tribunal was not entitled to determine the seat of arbitration and the record of proceedings held on 15.11.2003 at London cannot be construed as an agreement between the parties for change in the juridical seat of arbitration. He further argued that the PSC was between the Government of India and ONGC Ltd., Videocon Petroleum Ltd., Command Petroleum (India) Pvt. Ltd. and Ravva Oil (Singapore) Pvt. Ltd. and, therefore, the venue of arbitration cannot be treated to have been changed merely on the basis of the so called agreement between the appellant and the respondents. Learned Solicitor General submitted that any change in the PSC requires the concurrence by all the parties to the contract and the consent, if any, given by two of the parties cannot have the effect of changing the same. He then argued that every written agreement on behalf of respondent No.1 is required to be expressed in the name of the President and in the absence of any written agreement having been reached between the parties to the PSC to amend the same, the consent given for shifting the physical seat of 12 arbitration to London did not result in change of juridical seat of the arbitration which continues to be Kuala Lumpur. In support of this argument, the learned Solicitor General relied upon the judgments of this Court in Mulamchand v. State of Madhya Pradesh ( 1968) 3 SCR 214 and State of Haryana v. Lal Chand (1984) 3 SCR 715. In the end, he argued that the provisions of the English Arbitration Act, 1996 would have applied only if the seat of arbitration was in England and Wales. He submitted that London cannot be treated as juridical seat of arbitration merely because the parties had decided that the arbitration agreement contained in Article 34 will be governed by the laws of England. 11. We have considered the respective submissions and perused the record. 12. We shall first consider the question whether Kuala Lumpur was the designated seat or juridical seat of arbitration and the same had been shifted to London. In terms of clause 34.12 of the PSC entered into by 5 parties, the seat of arbitration was Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. However, due to outbreak of epidemic SARS, the arbitral tribunal decided to hold its sittings first at Amsterdam and then at London and the parties did not object to this. In the proceedings held on 14th and 15th October, 2003 at London, the arbitral 13 tribunal recorded the consent of the parties for shifting the juridical seat of arbitration to London. Whether this amounted to shifting of the physical or juridical seat of arbitration from Kuala Lumpur to London? The decision of this would depend on a holistic consideration of the relevant clauses of the PSC. Though, it may appear repetitive, we deem it necessary to mention that as per the terms of agreement, the seat of arbitration was Kuala Lumpur. If the parties wanted to amend clause 34.12, they could have done so only by written instrument which was required to be signed by all of them. Admittedly, neither there was any agreement between the parties to the PSC to shift the juridical seat of arbitration from Kuala Lumpur to London nor any written instrument was signed by them for amending clause 34.12. Therefore, the mere fact that the parties to the particular arbitration had agreed for shifting of the seat of arbitration to London cannot be interpreted as anything except physical change of the venue of arbitration from Kuala Lumpur to London. In this connection, reference can usefully be made to Section 3 of the English Arbitration Act, 1996, which reads as follows: ""3.The seat of the arbitration. In this Part ""the seat of the arbitration"" means the juridical seat of the arbitration designated-- (a) by the parties to the arbitration agreement, or (b) by any arbitral or other institution or person vested by the parties with powers in that regard, or 14 (c) by the arbitral tribunal if so authorised by the parties, or determined, in the absence of any such designation, having regard to the parties' agreement and all the relevant circumstances."" 13. A reading of the above reproduced provision shows that under the English law the seat of arbitration means juridical seat of arbitration, which can be designated by the parties to the arbitration agreement or by any arbitral or other institution or person empowered by the parties to do so or by the arbitral tribunal, if so authorised by the parties. In contrast, there is no provision in the Act under which the arbitral tribunal could change the juridical seat of arbitration which, as per the agreement of the parties, was Kuala Lumpur. Therefore, mere change in the physical venue of the hearing from Kuala Lumpur to Amsterdam and London did not amount to change in the juridical seat of arbitration. This is expressly indicated in Section 53 of the English Arbitration Act, 1996, which reads as under: ""53. Place where award treated as made. Unless otherwise agreed by the parties, where the seat of the arbitration is in England and Wales or Northern Ireland, any award in the proceedings shall be treated as made there, regardless of where it was signed, despatched or delivered to any of the parties."" 14. In Dozco India P. Ltd. v. Doosan Infracore Co. Ltd. 2010 (9) UJ 4521 (SC), the learned designated Judge while exercising power under 15 Section 11(6) of the Act, referred to the following passage from Redfern v. Hunter: ""The preceding discussion has been on the basis that there is only one ""place"" of arbitration. This will be the place chosen by or on behalf of the parties; and it will be designated in the arbitration agreement or the terms of reference or the minutes of proceedings or in some other way as the place or ""seat"" of the arbitration. This does not mean, however, that the arbitral tribunal must hold all its meetings or hearings at the place of arbitration. International commercial arbitration often involves people of many different nationalities, from many different countries. In these circumstances, it is by no means unusual for an arbitral tribunal to hold meetings - or even hearings - in a place other than the designated place of arbitration, either for its own convenience or for the convenience of the parties or their witnesses.... It may be more convenient for an arbitral tribunal sitting in one country to conduct a hearing in another country - for instance, for the purpose of taking evidence..... In such circumstances, each move of the arbitral tribunal does not of itself mean that the seat of the arbitration changes. The seat of the arbitration remains the place initially agreed by or on behalf of the parties."" 15. The next issue, which merits consideration is whether the Delhi High Court could entertain the petition filed by the respondents under Section 9 of the Act. In Bhatia International v. Bulk Trading S.A. (supra), the three- Judge Bench considered the important question whether Part I of the Act is applicable to the international arbitration taking place outside India. After noticing the scheme of the Act and argument of the appellant that Part I of the Act would apply only to the cases in which the venue of arbitration is in India, the Court observed: 16 ""A reading of the provisions shows that the said Act applies to arbitrations which are held in India between Indian nationals and to international commercial arbitrations whether held in India or out of India. Section 2(1)(f) defines an international commercial arbitration. The definition makes no distinction between international commercial arbitrations held in India or outside India. An international commercial arbitration may be held in a country which is a signatory to either the New York Convention or the Geneva Convention (hereinafter called ""the convention country""). An international commercial arbitration may be held in a non-convention country. The said Act nowhere provides that its provisions are not to apply to international commercial arbitrations which take place in a non-convention country. Admittedly, Part II only applies to arbitrations which take place in a convention country. Mr. Sen fairly admitted that Part II would not apply to an international commercial arbitration which takes place in a non-convention country. He also fairly admitted that there would be countries which are not signatories either to the New York Convention or to the Geneva Convention. It is not possible to accept the submission that the said Act makes no provision for international commercial arbitrations which take place in a non-convention country. Now let us look at sub-sections (2), (3), (4) and (5) of Section 2 . Sub-section (2) of Section 2 provides that Part I would apply where the place of arbitration is in India. To be immediately noted, that it is not providing that Part I shall not apply where the place of arbitration is not in India. It is also not providing that Part I will ""only"" apply where the place of arbitration is in India (emphasis supplied). Thus the legislature has not provided that Part I is not to apply to arbitrations which take place outside India. The use of the language is significant and important. The legislature is emphasising that the provisions of Part I would apply to arbitrations which take place in India, but not providing that the provisions of Part I will not apply to arbitrations which take place out of India. The wording of sub-section (2) of Section 2 suggests that the intention of the legislature was to make provisions of Part I compulsorily applicable to an arbitration, including an international commercial 17 arbitration, which takes place in India. Parties cannot, by agreement, override or exclude the non-derogable provisions of Part I in such arbitrations. By omitting to provide that Part I will not apply to international commercial arbitrations which take place outside India the effect would be that Part I would also apply to international commercial arbitrations held out of India. But by not specifically providing that the provisions of Part I apply to international commercial arbitrations held out of India, the intention of the legislature appears to be to ally (sic allow) parties to provide by agreement that Part I or any provision therein will not apply. Thus in respect of arbitrations which take place outside India even the non-derogable provisions of Part I can be excluded. Such an agreement may be express or implied. If read in this manner there would be no conflict between Section 1 and Section 2(2) . The words ""every arbitration"" in sub-section (4) of Section 2 and the words ""all arbitrations and to all proceedings relating thereto"" in sub-section (5) of Section 2 are wide. Sub-sections (4) and (5) of Section 2 are not made subject to sub-section (2) of Section 2 . It is significant that sub-section (5) is made subject to sub-section (4) but not to sub-section (2). To accept Mr. Sen's submission would necessitate adding words in sub-sections (4) and (5) of Section 2 , which the legislature has purposely omitted to add viz. ""subject to provision of sub-section (2)"". However read in the manner set out hereinabove there would also be no conflict between sub-section (2) of Section 2 and sub-sections (4) and/or (5) of Section 2 . That the legislature did not intend to exclude the applicability of Part I to arbitrations, which take place outside India, is further clear from certain other provisions of the said Act. Sub-section (7) of Section 2 reads as follows: ""2. (7) An arbitral award made under this Part shall be considered as a domestic award."" As is set out hereinabove the said Act applies to (a) arbitrations held in India between Indians, and (b) international commercial arbitrations. As set out hereinabove international commercial arbitrations may take place in India or outside India. Outside India, an international commercial 18 arbitration may be held in a convention country or in a non- convention country. The said Act however only classifies awards as ""domestic awards"" or ""foreign awards"". Mr. Sen admits that provisions of Part II make it clear that ""foreign awards"" are only those where the arbitration takes place in a convention country. Awards in arbitration proceedings which take place in a non-convention country are not considered to be ""foreign awards"" under the said Act. They would thus not be covered by Part II. An award passed in an arbitration which takes place in India would be a ""domestic award"". There would thus be no need to define an award as a ""domestic award"" unless the intention was to cover awards which would otherwise not be covered by this definition. Strictly speaking, an award passed in an arbitration which takes place in a non-convention country would not be a ""domestic award"". Thus the necessity is to define a ""domestic award"" as including all awards made under Part I. The definition indicates that an award made in an international commercial arbitration held in a non- convention country is also considered to be a ""domestic award"". (emphasis supplied) The Court then referred to Section 9 of the Act which empowers the Court to make interim orders and proceeded to observe: ""Thus under Section 9 a party could apply to the court (a) before, (b) during arbitral proceedings, or (c) after the making of the arbitral award but before it is enforced in accordance with Section 36 . The words ""in accordance with Section 36 "" can only go with the words ""after the making of the arbitral award"". It is clear that the words ""in accordance with Section 36 "" can have no reference to an application made ""before"" or ""during the arbitral proceedings"". Thus it is clear that an application for interim measure can be made to the courts in India, whether or not the arbitration takes place in India, before or during arbitral proceedings. Once an award is passed, then that award itself can be executed. Sections 49 and 58 provide that awards covered by Part II are deemed to be a decree of the court. Thus ""foreign 19 awards"" which are enforceable in India are deemed to be decrees. A domestic award has to be enforced under the provisions of the Civil Procedure Code. All that Section 36 provides is that an enforcement of a domestic award is to take place after the time to make an application to set aside the award has expired or such an application has been refused. Section 9 does suggest that once an award is made, an application for interim measure can only be made if the award is a ""domestic award"" as defined in Section 2(7) of the said Act. Thus where the legislature wanted to restrict the applicability of Section 9 it has done so specifically. We see no substance in the submission that there would be unnecessary interference by courts in arbitral proceedings. Section 5 provides that no judicial authority shall intervene except where so provided. Section 9 does not permit any or all applications. It only permits applications for interim measures mentioned in clauses (i) and (ii) thereof. Thus there cannot be applications under Section 9 for stay of arbitral proceedings or to challenge the existence or validity of the arbitration agreements or the jurisdiction of the Arbitral Tribunal. All such challenges would have to be made before the Arbitral Tribunal under the said Act."" The three-Judge Bench recorded its conclusion in the following words: ""To conclude, we hold that the provisions of Part I would apply to all arbitrations and to all proceedings relating thereto. Where such arbitration is held in India the provisions of Part I would compulsorily apply and parties are free to deviate only to the extent permitted by the derogable provisions of Part I. In cases of international commercial arbitrations held out of India provisions of Part I would apply unless the parties by agreement, express or implied, exclude all or any of its provisions. In that case the laws or rules chosen by the parties would prevail. Any provision, in Part I, which is contrary to or excluded by that law or rules will not apply."" (emphasis supplied) 20 16. In Venture Global Engineering v. Satyam Computer Services Limited (2008) 4 SCC 190, a two-Judge Bench was called upon to consider whether the Court of Additional Chief Judge, City Civil Court, Secunderabad had the jurisdiction to entertain the suit for declaration filed by the appellant to set aside the award passed by the sole arbitrator appointed at the instance of respondent No.1 despite the fact that the arbitrator had conducted the proceedings outside India. The trial Court had entertained and allowed the application filed by respondent No.1 under Order VII Rule 11 of the Code of Civil Procedure , 1908 ( CPC ) and rejected the plaint. The Andhra Pradesh High Court confirmed the order of the trial Court. Before this Court, reliance was placed by the appellant on the ratio of Bhatia International v. Bulk Trading S.A. (supra) and it was argued that the trial Court had the jurisdiction to entertain the suit. On behalf of the respondents, it was argued that the trial Court did not have the jurisdiction to entertain the suit because the award was made outside India. The Division Bench accepted the argument made on behalf of the appellant and observed: ""On close scrutiny of the materials and the dictum laid down in the three-Judge Bench decision in Bhatia International we agree with the contention of Mr. K.K. Venugopal and hold that paras 32 and 35 of Bhatia International make it clear that the provisions of Part I of the Act would apply to all arbitrations including international commercial arbitrations and to all proceedings relating thereto. We further hold that where such arbitration is held in India, the provisions of Part I would compulsorily apply and parties are free to deviate to the extent permitted by the provisions of Part I. It is also clear that even in the case of international commercial 21 arbitrations held out of India provisions of Part I would apply unless the parties by agreement, express or implied, exclude all or any of its provisions. We are also of the view that such an interpretation does not lead to any conflict between any of the provisions of the Act and there is no lacuna as such. The matter, therefore, is concluded by the three-Judge Bench decision in Bhatia International. The learned Senior Counsel for the respondent based on para 26 submitted that in the case of foreign award which was passed outside India is not enforceable in India by invoking the provisions of the Act or CPC . However, after critical analysis of para 26, we are unable to accept the argument of the learned Senior Counsel for the respondent. Paras 26 and 27 start by dealing with the arguments of Mr Sen who argued that Part I is not applicable to foreign awards. It is only in the sentence starting at the bottom of para 26 that the phrase ""it must immediately be clarified"" that the finding of the Court is rendered. That finding is to the effect that an express or implied agreement of parties can exclude the applicability of Part I. The finding specifically states: ""But if not so excluded, the provisions of Part I will also apply to all `foreign awards'."" This exception which is carved out, based on agreement of the parties, in para 21 (placita e to f) is extracted below: ""21. ... By omitting to provide that Part I will not apply to international commercial arbitrations which take place outside India the effect would be that Part I would also apply to international commercial arbitrations held out of India. But by not specifically providing that the provisions of Part I apply to international commercial arbitrations held out of India, the intention of the legislature appears to be to ally (sic allow) parties to provide by agreement that Part I or any provision therein will not apply. Thus in respect of arbitrations which take place outside India even the non-derogable provisions of Part I can be excluded. Such an agreement may be express or implied."" 22 The very fact that the judgment holds that it would be open to the parties to exclude the application of the provisions of Part I by express or implied agreement, would mean that otherwise the whole of Part I would apply. In any event, to apply Section 34 to foreign international awards would not be inconsistent with Section 48 of the Act, or any other provision of Part II as a situation may arise, where, even in respect of properties situate in India and where an award would be invalid if opposed to the public policy of India, merely because the judgment-debtor resides abroad, the award can be enforced against properties in India through personal compliance of the judgment-debtor and by holding out the threat of contempt as is being sought to be done in the present case. In such an event, the judgment-debtor cannot be deprived of his right under Section 34 to invoke the public policy of India, to set aside the award. As observed earlier, the public policy of India includes -- (a) the fundamental policy of India; or (b) the interests of India; or (c) justice or morality; or (d) in addition, if it is patently illegal. This extended definition of public policy can be bypassed by taking the award to a foreign country for enforcement."" 17. We may now advert to the judgment of the learned Single Judge of the Gujarat High Court in Hardy Oil and Gas Limited v. Hindustan Oil Exploration Company Limited and others (2006) 1 GLR 658. The facts of that case were that an agreement was entered into between Unocal Bharat Limited, Hardy Oil and Gas Limited, Netherland B.V. (Hardy), Infrastructure Leasing and Financial Services Limited, Housing Development Finance Corporation Limited and Hindustan Oil Exploration Company Limited on 14.10.1998. The agreement had an arbitration clause. A dispute having arisen between the parties, the matter was referred to the arbitral tribunal. During the pendency of the arbitration proceedings, an 23 application was filed by the appellant in the District Court, Vadodara under Section 9 of the Act. A preliminary objection was raised to the maintainability of that petition. The learned District Judge accepted the objection. The learned Single Judge of Gujarat High Court referred to clause 9.5 of the agreement, which was as under: ""9.5 Governing Law and Arbitration 1. This Agreement (except for the provisions of Clause 9.5.4 relating to arbitration) shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the substantive laws of India. 2. Any dispute or difference of whatever nature arising under, out of, or in connection with this Agreement, including any question regarding its existence, validity or termination, which the parties are unable to resolve between themselves within sixty (60) days of notification by one or more Parties to the other(s) that a dispute exists for the purpose of this Clause 9 shall at the instance of any Party be referred to and finally resolved by Arbitration under the rules of the London Court of International Arbitration (SLCIA), which Rules (Rules) are deemed to be incorporated by reference into this clause. 3. The Tribunal shall consist of two arbitrators who shall be Queen's Counsel, practicing at the English Bar in the Commercial Division of the High Court, one to be selected by the Parties invoking the Arbitration clause acting unanimously and one to be selected by the other shareholders acting unanimously, and one umpire who shall also be a Queen's Counsel, practicing at the English Bar in the Commercial Division of this High Court. If the parties are unable to agree on the identity of the umpire within 15 days from the day on which the matter is referred to arbitration, the umpire shall be chosen and appointed by LCIA. Notwithstanding Article 3.3 of the Rules, the Parties agree that LICA may appoint a British umpire. No arbitrator shall be a person or former employee or agent of, or consultant or counsel to, any Party or any Associated 24 Company or any Party or in any way otherwise connected with any of the Parties. 4. The place of arbitration shall be London and the language of arbitration shall be English. The law governing arbitration will be the English law. 5. Any decision or award of an arbitral tribunal shall be final and binding on the Parties."" The learned Single Judge referred to various judgments of this Court including Bhatia International v. Bulk Trading S.A. (supra), Shreejee Traco (I) Pvt. Ltd. v. Paperline International Inc. ( 2003) 9 SCC 79, National Thermal Power Corporation v. Singer Company (1992) 3 SCC 551 and upheld the order of the learned District Judge by observing that in terms of clause 9.5.4 of the agreement, the place of arbitration was London and the law governing arbitration was the English law. The learned Single Judge referred to paragraph 32 of the judgment in Bhatia International v. Bulk Trading S.A. (supra) and observed that once the parties had agreed to be governed by any law other than Indian law in cases of international commercial arbitration, then that law would prevail and the provisions of the Act cannot be invoked questioning the arbitration proceedings or the award. This is evident from paragraph 11.3 of the judgment, which is extracted below: ""However, their Lordships observed in Para.32 that in cases of international commercial arbitrations held out of India provisions of Part-I would apply unless the parties by agreement, express or implied, exclude all or any of its 25 provisions. In that case laws or rules chosen by the parties would prevail. Any provision, in Part-I, which is contrary to or excluded by that law or rules would not apply. Thus, even as per the decision relied upon by learned advocate for the appellant, if the parties have agreed to be governed by any law other than Indian law in cases of international commercial arbitration, same would prevail. In the case on hand, it is very clear even on plain reading of Clause 9.5.4 that the parties' intention was to be governed by English law in respect of arbitration. It is not possible to give a narrow meaning to this clause as suggested by learned Senior Advocate Mr. Thakore that it would apply only in case of dispute on Arbitration Agreement. It can be interpreted only to mean that in case of any dispute regarding arbitration, English law would apply. When the clause deals with the place and language of arbitration with a specific provision that the law governing arbitration will be the English law, such a narrow meaning cannot be given. No other view is possible in light of exception carved out of Clause 9.5.1 relating to arbitration. Term Arbitration, in Clause 9.5.4 cannot be taken to mean arbitration agreement. Entire arbitral proceedings have to be taken to be agreed to be governed by English law."" 18. In our opinion, the learned Single Judge of Gujarat High Court had rightly followed the conclusion recorded by the three-Judge Bench in Bhatia International v. Bulk Trading S.A. (supra) and held that the District Court, Vadodara did not have the jurisdiction to entertain the petition filed under Section 9 of the Act because the parties had agreed that the law governing the arbitration will be English law. 19. In the present case also, the parties had agreed that notwithstanding Article 33.1 , the arbitration agreement contained in Article 34 shall be 26 governed by laws of England. This necessarily implies that the parties had agreed to exclude the provisions of Part I of the Act . As a corollary to the above conclusion, we hold that the Delhi High Court did not have the jurisdiction to entertain the petition filed by the respondents under Section 9 of the Act and the mere fact that the appellant had earlier filed similar petitions was not sufficient to clothe that High Court with the jurisdiction to entertain the petition filed by the respondents. 20. In the result, the appeal is allowed. The impugned order is set aside and the petition filed by the respondents under Section 9 of the Act is dismissed. ..................................J. [R.V.

"Bhagwan Dass vs State (Nct) Of Delhi on 9 May, 2011","1117","@ SPECIAL LEAVE PETITION (CRL.) NO.1208 OF 2011 Bhagwan Dass .. Appellant -versus- State (NCT) of Delhi .. Respondent(s) J U D G M E N T Markandey Katju, J. ""Hai maujazan ek kulzum-e-khoon kaash yahi ho Aataa hai abhi dekhiye kya kya mere aage"" -- Mirza Ghalib 2 1. This is yet another case of gruesome honour killing, this time by the accused-appellant of his own daughter. 2. Leave granted. 3. Heard learned counsels for the parties and perused the record. 4. The prosecution case is that the appellant was very annoyed with his daughter, who had left her husband Raju and was living in an incestuous relationship with her uncle, Sriniwas. This infuriated the appellant as he thought this conduct of his daughter Seema had dishonoured his family, and hence he strangulated her with an electric wire. The trial court convicted the appellant and this judgment was upheld by the High Court. Hence this appeal. 5. This is a case of circumstantial evidence, but it is settled law that a person can be convicted on circumstantial evidence 3 provided the links in the chain of circumstances connects the accused with the crime beyond reasonable doubt vide Vijay Kumar Arora vs. State (NCT of Delhi ), ( 2010) 2 SCC 353 (para 16.5), Aftab Ahmad Ansari vs. State of Uttaranchal , (2010) 2 SCC 583 (vide paragraphs 13 and 14), etc. In this case, we are satisfied that the prosecution has been able to prove its case beyond reasonable doubt by establishing all the links in the chain of circumstances. 6. In cases of circumstantial evidence motive is very important, unlike cases of direct evidence where it is not so important vide Wakkar and Anr. vs. State of Uttar Pradesh (2011) 3 SCC 306 (para 14). In the present case, the prosecution case was that the motive of the appellant in murdering his daughter was that she was living in adultery with one Sriniwas, who was the son of the maternal aunt of the appellant. The appellant felt humiliated by this, and to avenge the family honour he murdered his own daughter. 4 7. We have carefully gone through the judgment of the trial court as well as the High Court and we are of the opinion that the said judgments are correct. 8. The circumstances which connect the accused to the crime are: i) The motive of the crime which has already been mentioned above. In our country unfortunately `honour killing' has become common place, as has been referred to in our judgment in Arumugam Servai vs. State of Tamil Nadu Criminal Appeal No.958 of 2011 (@SLP(Crl) No.8084 of 2009) pronounced on 19.4.2011. Many people feel that they are dishonoured by the behaviour of the young man/woman, who is related to them or belonging to their caste because he/she is marrying against their wish or having an affair with someone, and hence they take the law into their own hands and kill or physically assault such person or commit some other atrocities on them. We have held in Lata 5 Singh vs. State of U.P. & Anr. (2006) 5 SCC 475, that this is wholly illegal. If someone is not happy with the behaviour of his daughter or other person, who is his relation or of his caste, the maximum he can do is to cut off social relations with her/him, but he cannot take the law into his own hands by committing violence or giving threats of violence. ii) As per the post mortem report which was conducted at 11.45 am on 16.5.2006 the likely time of death of Seema was 32 hours prior to the post mortem. Giving a margin of two hours, plus or minus, it would be safe to conclude that Seema died sometime between 2.00 am to 6.00 am on 15.5.2006. However, the appellant, in whose house Seema was staying, did not inform the police or anybody else for a long time. It was only some unknown person who telephonically informed the police at 2.00 pm on 15.5.2006 that the appellant had murdered his own daughter. This omission by the appellant in not informing the police about the death of his daughter for about 10 hours was a 6 totally unnatural conduct on his part. iii) The appellant had admitted that the deceased Seema had stayed in his house on the night of 14.5.2006/15.5.2006. The appellant's mother was too old to commit the crime, and there is not even a suggestion by the defence that his brother may have committed it. Hence we can safely rule out the possibility that someone else, other than the appellant, committed the crime. Seema had left her husband sometime back and was said to be living in an adulterous and incestuous relationship with her uncle (her father's cousin), and this obviously made the appellant very hostile to her. On receiving the telephonic information at about 2.00 pm from some unknown person, the police reached the house of the accused and found the dead body of Seema on the floor in the back side room of the house. The accused and his family members and some neighbours were there at that time. The accused admitted that although Seema had been married about 7 three years ago, she had left her husband and was living in her father's house for about one month. Thus there was both motive and opportunity for the appellant to commit the murder. iv) It has come in evidence that the accused appellant with his family members were making preparation for her last rites when the police arrived. Had the police not arrived they would probably have gone ahead and cremated Seema even without a post mortem so as to destroy the evidence of strangulation. v) The mother of the accused, Smt. Dhillo Devi stated before the police that her son (the accused) had told her that he had killed Seema. No doubt a statement to the police is ordinarily not admissible in evidence in view of Section 162(1) Cr.PC, but as mentioned in the proviso to Section 162(1) Cr.PC it can be used to contradict the testimony of a witness. Smt. Dhillo Devi also appeared as a witness before the trial court, and in her cross examination, she was confronted with her statement to the police to whom she had stated that her son (the accused) had told her 8 that he had killed Seema. On being so confronted with her statement to the police she denied that she had made such statement. We are of the opinion that the statement of Smt. Dhillo Devi to the police can be taken into consideration in view of the proviso to Section 162(1) Cr.PC, and her subsequent denial in court is not believable because she obviously had afterthoughts and wanted to save her son (the accused) from punishment. In fact in her statement to the police she had stated that the dead body of Seema was removed from the bed and placed on the floor. When she was confronted with this statement in the court she denied that she had made such statement before the police. We are of the opinion that her statement to the police can be taken into consideration in view of the proviso of Section 162(1) Cr.PC. In our opinion the statement of the accused to his mother Smt. Dhillo Devi is an extra judicial confession. In a very recent 9 case this Court in Kulvinder Singh & Anr. vs. State of Haryana Criminal Appeal No.916 of 2005 decided on 11.4.2011 referred to the earlier decision of this Court in State of Rajasthan vs. Raja Ram (2003) 8 SCC 180, where it was held (vide para 10) : ""An extra-judicial confession, if voluntary and true and made in a fit state of mind, can be relied upon by the court. The confession will have to be proved like any other fact. The value of the evidence as to confession, like any other evidence, depends upon the veracity of the witness to whom it has been made. The value of the evidence as to the confession depends on the relia- bility of the witness who gives the evidence. It is not open to any court to start with a presumption that ex- tra-judicial confession is a weak type of evidence. It would depend on the nature of the circumstances, the time when the confession was made and the credibility of the witnesses who speak to such a confession. Such a confession can be relied upon and conviction can be founded thereon if the evidence about the confession comes from the mouth of witnesses who appear to be unbiased, not even remotely inimical to the accused, and in respect of whom nothing is brought out which may tend to indicate that he may have a motive of at- tributing an untruthful statement to the accused, the words spoken to by the witness are clear, unambiguous and unmistakably convey that the accused is the perpe- trator of the crime and nothing is omitted by the wit- ness which may militate against it. After subjecting the evidence of the witness to a rigorous test on the touch- stone of credibility, the extra-judicial confession can be 10 accepted and can be the basis of a conviction if it pass- es the test of credibility."" In the above decision it was also held that a conviction can be based on circumstantial evidence. Similarly, in B.A. Umesh vs. Registrar General, High Court of Karnataka, (2011) 3 SCC 85 the Court relied on the extra judicial confession of the accused. No doubt Smt. Dhillo Devi was declared hostile by the prosecution as she resiled from her earlier statement to the police. However, as observed in State vs. Ram Prasad Mishra & Anr. : ""The evidence of a hostile witness would not be totally rejected if spoken in favour of the prosecution or the accused, but can be subjected to close scrutiny and the portion of the evidence which is consistent with the case of the prosecution or defence may be accepted."" Similarly in Sheikh Zakir vs. State of Bihar AIR 1983 SC 911 this Court held : ""It is not quite strange that some witnesses do turn hostile but that by itself would not prevent a court from finding an accused guilty if there is otherwise acceptable evidence in support of the conviction."" 11 In Himanshu alias Chintu vs. State (NCT of Delhi), (2011) 2 SCC 36 this Court held that the dependable part of the evidence of a hostile witness can be relied on. Thus it is the duty of the Court to separate the grain from the chaff, and the maxim ""falsus in uno falsus in omnibus"" has no application in India vide Nisar Alli vs. The State of Uttar Pradesh AIR 1957 SC 366. In the present case we are of the opinion that Smt. Dhillo Devi denied her earlier statement from the police because she wanted to save her son. Hence we accept her statement to the police and reject her statement in court. The defence has not shown that the police had any enmity with the accused, or had some other reason to falsely implicate him. We are of the opinion that this was a clear case of murder and the entire circumstances point to the guilt of the accused. vi) The cause of death was opined by Dr. Pravindra Singh-PW1 12 in his post mortem report as death ""due to asphyxia as a result of ante-mortem strangulation by ligature."" It is evident that this is a case of murder, and not suicide. The body was not found hanging but lying on the ground. vii) The accused made a statement to the SDM, Shri S.S. Parihar-PW8, immediately after the incident and has signed the same. No doubt he claimed in his statement under Section 313 Cr.PC that nothing was asked by the SDM but he did not clarify how his signature appeared on the statement, nor did he say that he was forced to sign his statement nor was the statement challenged in the cross examination of the SDM. The SDM appeared as a witness before the trial court and he has proved the statement in his evidence. There was no cross examination by the accused although opportunity was given. In his statement under Section 313 Cr.PC the accused was asked : ""Q.8 It is in evidence against you that you were interrogated and arrested vide memo Ex PW11/C and your personal search was conducted vide memo Ex 13 PW11/D and you made disclosure statement EXPW7/A and in pursuance thereto you pointed out the site plan of incident and got recovered an electric wire Ex P1 which was seized by IO after sealing the same vide memo ExPW7/B. What do you have to say? The reply he gave was as follows : ""Ans. I was wrongly arrested and falsely implicated in this case. I never made any disclosure statement. I did not get any wire recovered nor I was ever taken again to my house."" We see no reason to disbelieve the SDM as there is nothing to show that he had any enmity against the accused or had any other reason for making a false statement in Court. viii) The accused had given a statement (Ex. PW7/A) to the SDM in the presence of PW11 Inspector Nand Kumar which led to discovery of the electric wire by which the crime was committed. We are of the opinion that this disclosure was admissible as evidence under Section 27 of the Evidence Act vide Aftab Ahmad Ansari vs. State , (2010) 2 SCC 583 (para 40), Manu Sharma vs. State, (2010) 6 SCC 1 (paragraphs 234 to 238). In his evidence the police Inspector Nand Kumar stated that at the 14 pointing out of the accused the electric wire with which the accused is alleged to have strangulated his daughter ws recovered from under a bed in a room. It has been contended by the learned counsel for the appellant that there was no independent witness in the case. However, as held by this Court in State of Rajasthan vs. Teja Ram and Ors. AIR 1999 SC 1776 : ""The over-insistence on witnesses having no relation with the victims often results in criminal justice going awry. When any incident happens in a dwelling house, the most natural witnesses would be the inmates of that house. It is unpragmatic to ignore such natural witnesses and insist on outsiders who would not have even seen anything. If the court has discerned from the evidence or even from the investigation records that some other independent person has witnessed any event connecting the incident in question, then there is a justification for making adverse comments against non-examination of such a person as a prosecution wit- ness. Otherwise, merely on surmises the court should not castigate the prosecution for not examining other persons of the locality as prosecution witnesses. The prosecution can be expected to examine only those who have witnessed the events and not those who have not seen it though the neighbourhood may be replete with other residents also."" Similarly, in Trimukh Maroti Kirkan vs. State of 15 Maharashtra (2006)1 SCC 681 this Court observed: ""These crimes are generally committed in complete se- crecy inside the house and it becomes very difficult for the prosecution to lead evidence. No member of the family, even if he is a witness of the crime, would come forward to depose against another family member. The neighbours, whose evidence may be of some assis- tance, are generally reluctant to depose in court as they want to keep aloof and do not want to antagonize a neighbourhood family. The parents or other family members of the bride being away from the scene of commission of crime are not in a position to give direct evidence which may inculpate the real accused except regarding the demand of money or dowry and harass- ment caused to the bride. But, it does not mean that a crime committed in secrecy or inside the house should go unpunished."" (emphasis supplied) In our opinion both the trial court and High Court have given very cogent reasons for convicting the appellant, and we see no reason to disagree with their verdicts. There is overwhelming circumstantial evidence to show that the accused committed the crime as he felt that he was dishonoured by his daughter. For the reason given above we find no force in this appeal and it is dismissed. Before parting with this case we would like to state that 16 `honour' killings have become commonplace in many parts of the country, particularly in Haryana, western U.P., and Rajasthan. Often young couples who fall in love have to seek shelter in the police lines or protection homes, to avoid the wrath of kangaroo courts. We have held in Lata Singh 's case (supra) that there is nothing `honourable' in `honour' killings, and they are nothing but barbaric and brutal murders by bigoted, persons with feudal minds. In our opinion honour killings, for whatever reason, come within the category of rarest of rare cases deserving death punishment. It is time to stamp out these barbaric, feudal practices which are a slur on our nation. This is necessary as a deterrent for such outrageous, uncivilized behaviour. All persons who are planning to perpetrate `honour' killings should know that the gallows await them. Let a copy of this judgment be sent to the Registrar Generals/Registrars of all the High Courts who shall circulate the same to all Judges of the Courts. The Registrar 17 General/Registrars of the High Courts will also circulate copies of the same to all the Sessions Judges/Additional Sessions Judges in the State/Union Territories. Copies of the judgment shall also be sent to all the Chief Secretaries/Home Secretaries/Director Generals of Police of all States/Union Territories in the country. The Home Secretaries and Director Generals of Police will circulate the same to all S.S.Ps/S.Ps in the States/Union Territories for information. ...................................J.
