Bench: 
B.S. Chauhan
, 
J.M. Panchal


                                  IN THE SUPREME COURT OF INDIA
                       CRIMINAL APPELLATE JURISDICTION

                     CRIMINAL APPEAL NO. 716 OF 2010
               [arising out of SLP(CRL.) No. 171 of 2010]

DHARMAN                                           .....              APPELLANTS



                                       VERSUS

STATE OF KERALA                                   .....              RESPONDENT




                                     O R D E R



1.       Leave    granted.

2.       The     instant      appeal    is     directed    against    the


judgment and order dated 8th April, 2009 rendered in

Criminal Appeal No. 340 of 2002 by the High Court of

Kerala     at    Ernakulam      by     which      the   conviction    and

sentence of the appellant recorded under 
Section 55(1)


of the Abkari Act has been set aside .                    The conviction

under Section 55(a) of the said Act was maintained and

was sentenced to rigorous imprisonment for one year and

fine of Rs. 1 lakh and in default rigorous imprisonment

for six months.



3.       This Court has heard the learned counsel for the

parties.        In view of the concurrent findings of fact,

this   Court      is    not   inclined       to   interfere    with   the

conviction       of    the    appellant      recorded     under   
Section

55(a)
 of the Act.              However, as far as sentence is
concerned, the appellant has averred that he is a poor

man    and     not    able     to   pay    fine    of    Rs.    1   lakh    and

therefore, the sentence imposed on him in default of

fine be reduced suitably.



4.       Having regard to the facts of the case and the

fact    that    the        appellant   has    already      undergone       four

months of the sentence imposed on him for commission of

offence under 
Section 55(a)
 of the Act and that the

default sentence imposed on him be reduced as he is not

in a position to pay Rs. 1 lakh fine imposed on him,

this    Court        has    heard    the    learned      counsel    for     the

parties.



5.       The     record        shows       that    the     appellant       was

intercepted          and    found    transporting        four    bottles     of

750ml each and five bottles of 180ml each of Indian

Made Foreign Liquor kept in polythene bag.                          The fact

that the appellant is poor is not disputed before this

Court.       The record further shows that on June 17, 2009

the appellant had donated one kidney as a result of

which    he     frequently          complains      about       weakness     and

recurrent       urinary       infection.          Having   regard     to   the

feeble health of the appellant, this Court is of the

opinion that interest of justice would be served if the

appellant is sentenced to imprisonment to that which he

has already undergone and default sentence imposed on

him is reduced to one month for commission of offence
punishable under 
Section 55(a)
 of the Act.


6.    For   the   foregoing   reasons,   the    appeal     partly

succeeds, the conviction of the appellant under 
Section

55(a)
 of the Abkari Act is maintained.              However, the

appellant   is    sentenced     to   imprisonment          already

undergone   whereas   default    sentence      of    six   months

imposed him is reduced to one month.


      Subject to above modification, the appeal stands

disposed of.
