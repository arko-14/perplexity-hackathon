                CIVIL APPEAL NO.300 OF 2010

                         O   R   D   E   R


       Leave granted.

       Heard learned advocates on both sides.
       We are setting aside the impugned order on the
ground that it does not give any reasons whatsoever.           We
do not express any opinion on the merits of the case.          We
expressly make it clear that all contentions on both sides
are kept open.     The High Court will decide the matter de
novo in accordance with law.

       Accordingly, the civil appeal stands disposed of
with no order as to costs.



                                          ......................J.
                                         [S.H. KAPADIA]
