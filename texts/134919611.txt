Bench: 
J.M. Panchal
, 
Harjit Singh Bedi


           CA 7178 of 2002
                                               1




                              IN THE SUPREME COURT OF INDIA
                               CIVIL APPELLATE JURISDICTION

                              CIVIL APPEAL NO. 7178 OF 2002


       U.O.I. & ORS.                                   .....          APPELLANT



                                            VERSUS

       BALBIR SINGH DHARNI & ORS.                      .....          RESPONDENT




                                           O R D E R



         1.       We   find   from   the    impugned    judgment   that   a   very

         limited relief had been granted to the respondent herein.

         The relevant portion of the judgment is reproduced below:


                        "In view of the above, the writ petition
                  is allowed with a direction to the respondents
                  to reconsider the entire matter and to pass a
                  speaking order in accordance with law.      It
                  goes without saying that the petitioner shall
                  be entitled to all consequential benefits,
                  which would flow from the quashing of the
                  impugned order."



         2.       We are unable to understand as to why, in the light

         of the above observations, the Union of India has chosen

         to file an appeal against the order as no decision on

         merits had been rendered or any opinion expressed thereon

         by the Division Bench of the High Court.
CA 7178 of 2002

                                        2


         3.       We, accordingly, dismiss the appeal.   The impugned

         judgments be complied with as expeditiously as possible as

         the respondent has been out of service since long.





                                               ..................J
                                               [HARJIT SINGH BEDI]




                                               ..................J
                                               [J.M. PANCHAL]
