                              IN THE SUPREME COURT OF INDIA

                       CIVIL APPELLATE JURISDICTION

                  CIVIL APPEAL NO.998 OF 2010
         (Arising out of S.L.P. (C) No.27298 of 2009)


National Insurance Co. Ltd. & Ors.                               ...Appellant(s)


                                       Versus


T. Mahendran                                                   ...Respondent(s)


                                 O    R    D   E    R


         Leave granted.
         By     consent,       the      matter     is   take       up       for     final
hearing.

         Heard learned counsel on both sides.

         In this case, vide order dated 8th February, 2008,
passed by the High Court of Karnataka in Criminal Appeal
No.1551 of 2001, the order of conviction passed by the
C.B.I.    Court    on     27th       October,      2001,      stood      set      aside.
Consequent      upon     the     said      judgement       dated      8th    February,
2008,    the    respondent           herein,      who   was      an     employee       of
National Insurance Company Limited, sought re-instatement
with    backwages,       which       stands    allowed      by     reason         of   the
impugned       order    passed        by    the    Division        Bench       of      the
Karnakata High Court on 19th February, 2009 in Writ Appeal
No.1904 of 2008.          As a result          of the impugned order, the

                                 - 2 -

respondent herein has made a claim on National Insurance
Company     Limited    towards   backwages     and   other     benefits
[including promotion] for an approximate amount of Rupees
seventeen lakhs.       Unfortunately, in the present case, the
High Court has not given detailed reasons for awarding
backwages    and    other   benefits.     It   may   be   incidentally
mentioned    that     the   Management   had   passed     an   order   of
dismissal on 13th September, 2002.         However, the Management
has reinstated the respondent on 19th December, 2008.

          The grievance made by the appellants herein is that
the High Court has not examined in detail as to whether
the respondent was automatically entitled to backwages and
other benefits consequent upon re-instatement, including
promotion.    We agree with this submission.

          In the circumstances, we remit this case to the
High Court to consider the above-mentioned aspect only in
Writ Appeal No.1904 of 2008.         We express no opinion on the
contentions raised by the parties before us.                   However,
since this is a limited aspect on which the High Court
needs to give its opinion, we request the High Court to
expeditiously hear and dispose of Writ Appeal No.1904 of
2008, leaving all the contentions open, within a period of
three months from today.

          The civil appeal is, accordingly, allowed with no
order as to costs.
