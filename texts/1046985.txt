INDERJIT SINGH                                            ... APPELLANT(S)

                 VERSUS

STATE OF PUNJAB TR.COLLECTOR          & ANR.              ... RESPONDENT(S)


                                      O R D E R



           Leave granted. Delay condoned.

           The appellant was an Ahlmad in the Court of Civil Judge

(Junior Division), at Barnala in Punjab.                  On 14.06.1996 at about

7.30   p.m.,   when    some   of   the   Judicial    Officers     made    a   surprise

inspection of the Court premises, they found the appellant, one

Chowkidar and a constable at the premises.                  They found that these

persons were drinking alcohol within the court premises.                  The matter

was reported to the District Judge and thereafter an inquiry was

conducted and the appellant was found guilty and his services were

terminated.    The    appellant     challenged      the    same   by   way    of   Writ

Petition before the High Court and the same was dismissed. Aggrieved

by the same, he is before this Court by way of this appeal.


           Heard learned amicus curiae and learned counsel for the

State.



           It is pointed out by learned counsel for the appellant

that one of the persons, who was on duty at that time along with the

appellant herein,       though found guilty in the inquiry,              has filed an

appeal    before      this    Court      and      this Court allowed his appeal

                                         2


and he was ordered to be re-instated in service vide order dated 4th

February    2002   in   Civil   Appeal   No.943   of   2002.     The   present

appellant was not on duty on that day but he was found at the court

premises.    Though we deprecate the conduct shown by the appellant,

but having regard to the fact that he has to maintain his family and

also for the reason that his colleague was reinstated in service, we

direct that the appellant be reinstated in service.              We make it

clear that he is not entitled to any back-wages or any other service

benefits.    He is directed to be reinstated within a period of one

month from this date and his previous service may be reckoned only

for the purpose of pension.



            The appeal is disposed of accordingly.        No costs.
