RANJIT SINGH                                         Appellant(s)
                          :VERSUS:

                            O R D E R



         Leave granted.



 
Heard the learned counsel for the parties.

         The appellant was sentenced to imprisonment for

life under 
Section 302
 of the Indian Penal Code (
I.P.C
.),

10 years' rigorous imprisonment under 
Section 307
 I.P.C.

and 10 years' rigorous imprisonment under 
Section 333


I.P.C.    While   sentencing   the   appellant,      the   Additional

Sessions Judge, Ludhiana, did not grant him benefit of

set   off   under   
Section    428
   of   the   Code   of   Criminal

Procedure, on the basis of the judgment of this Court in


Kartar Singh vs. State of Haryana
, [AIR 1982 SC 1439 =

1982 (3) SCC 1].






                               -2-


A Constitution Bench of this Court in the case of


Bhagirath vs. Delhi Administration
, [1985 (2) SCC 580],

has   specifically   overruled    Kartar   Singh's   judgment

(supra), the relevant paragraph of which reads as under:


             "We have considered with great care the
      reasoning upon which the decision in Kartar
      Singh (1982 3 SCC 1) proceeds. With respect,
      we are unable to agree with the decision. We
      have already discussed why imprisonment for
      life is imprisonment for a term, within the
      meaning of 
section 428
. We would like to add
      that we find it difficult to agree that the
      expressions   'imprisonment    for   life'    and
      'imprisonment for a term' are used either in
      the Penal Code or in the 
Criminal Procedure
      Code
 in contradistinction with each other.
      
Sections 304
, 
305
, 
307
 and 
394
 of the Penal
      Code undoutedly provide that persons guilty of
      the respective offences, shall be punished
      with    imprisonment    for    life   or     with
      imprisonment for a term not exceeding a
      certain number of years. But, that is the only
      manner in which the Legislature could have
      expressed its intention that persons who are
      guilty of those offences shall be punished
      with either of the sentences mentioned in the
      respective sections. The circumstances on
      which the learned Judges have placed reliance
      in Kartar Singh, do not afford any evidence,
      intrinsic or otherwise, of the use of the two
      expressions in contradistinction with each
      other. Two or more expressions are often used
      in the same section in order to exhaust the
      alternatives   which   are  available    to   the
      Legislature. That does not mean that there is,
      necessarily,   an   antithesis   between    those
      expressions."



                            -3-


      In our considered view, the appellant is entitled

to the benefit of set off under 
Section 428
 of the Code

of Criminal Procedure.





      The appeals are partly allowed and disposed of in

the above terms.
