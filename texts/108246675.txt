                          CRIMINAL APPEAL NO. 1164 OF 2003



                                           O R D E R



    1.       We    have       heard    the      learned       counsel       for    the

    parties.



    2.       Although special leave had been granted way back

    in   2003,     subsequent         to   the    grant       of    leave    certain

    developments have taken place which require that the

    matter     should      be    reconsidered           by    the    High     Court.

    Pursuant      to    the     orders     of    the     High      Court    made    in

    Criminal Complaint No. 5 of 2003 in C.P                         No. 18 of 1999

    a    Special       Officer     had     been        appointed      to     suggest

                                         2



measures and ways for the revival of the Company and to

ensure that the dues of the Company were duly settled.

This report dated 23rd December, 2009 is on file.                        It

has come on page 71 of the additional documents filed

by the appellants that the creditors/claimants seeking

payment      from     the       appellant-Company            have      been

substantially settled though some disputes still remain

for which some amounts have been kept aside.                        In para

11 of the Report afore-referred, the Special Officer

has suggested as under:



              "Regarding misfeasance applications,
     criminal        complaints         and   debts       claims
     pending    before        this     Hon'ble    Court.        As

     mentioned in para 210 to 220 (page No. 95

     to 99) of report No. 7, the decision of the
     Committee          be      approved,          misfeasance
     application        may     be     dismissed,       criminal
     complaints       pending        before      this    Hon'ble
     Court     may    be      closed     as   settled        while
     criminal cases pending against the former
     Directors before the lower court (which is

     mentioned at para 221 and 222 page No. 99

     and 100 of report No. 7) may be quashed by
     the Hon'ble High Court invoking in powers
     under 482 of 
Criminal Procedure Code
, in
     the     interest      of   promoting        the    ends   of
     justice, preventing the abuse of process
     and     facilitating        the      revival       of     the
     company."



3.    In the light of the aforesaid suggestions and

                                             3



 keeping in view of the above facts, it is appropriate

 that the matter should be remitted to the High Court

 for     reconsideration         as    the   matter       for     revival    of

 company         is    pending    before         the   High     Court.      We,

 accordingly, quash the orders of both the Company Judge

 dated    26th    November,      2002    and      that    of    the   Division

 Bench dated 23rd May, 2003 and remit the case to the

 High Court for decision afresh and to make an order in

 the backdrop of the report of the Special Officer.


 4.       The     appeals        are    accordingly            disposed     of.


 5.       In     the   light     of    the   above       order,    all    other

 pending applications are disposed of.
