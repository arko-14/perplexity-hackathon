                        IN THE SUPREME COURT OF INDIA

                        CIVIL APPELLATE JURISDICTION

             SPECIAL LEAVE PETITION(C)NO.12299 OF 2004

UNION OF INDIA                                            ... PETITIONER(S)

                 VERSUS

M/S.HARBANS SINGH TULI & SONS BUILD.(P)LTD.               ... RESPONDENT(S)


                                   O R D E R



         Heard learned Additional Solicitor General of India and

the respondent-in person.



         This Court, by an order dated 24th August, 2007, appointed

the Arbitrator and the Arbitrator filed the Award on 26.04.2008. The

petitioner-Union   of     India   was   given   an   opportunity   to   file   its

objections to the Award and the objections were filed on 22.10.2008,

after the period prescribed had expired.


         One of the contentions raised by the Union of India is

that this Court had specifically directed that the Award should be a

reasoned one and yet the impugned Award lacks the particulars and

the Award is not sustainable in law. The Arbitrator has stated that

the relevant records were not produced by the Union of India before

the Arbitrator and in support of the claim, the claimant had filed

affidavits and the deponents were available for cross-examination

but they were not cross-examined by the appellant.            It being so, the

Arbitrator   was     not     in    a     position to give detailed reasons.

                                        2


Therefore, the lack of detailed reasons cannot be claimed as an

infirmity and the Award can only be accepted.                      It may also be

noticed that all the claims have been only partly allowed; only ten

percent of the total claim of the respondent had been upheld by the

Arbitrator.      Therefore, the objections are rejected and the Award

passed   by    the   Arbitrator   is   made   decree   of    the    Court   and   the

respondent would be at liberty to take other appropriate steps for

execution of the decree.



              The awarded amount would be paid within a period of two

months from the date of this order.



              Applications are disposed of accordingly.
