Assistant Commr vs M/S Shyam Trading Corp on 15 January, 2010


Equivalent citations: AIRONLINE 2010 SC 352


Bench: 
Swatanter Kumar
, 
S.H. Kapadia


                           IN THE SUPREME COURT OF INDIA

                CIVIL APPELLATE JURISDICTION

                CIVIL APPEAL NO.301 OF 2010
        (Arising out of S.L.P. (C) No.3654 of 2009)

Assistant Commissioner, Commercial Tax               ...Appellant(s)


                             Versus


M/s. Shyam Trading Corporation                       ...Respondent(s)


                         O   R   D   E     R


        Leave granted.

 
None appears for the respondent, though served.
        The impugned order, as usual, is a cryptic order.
Be that as it may, the impugned order has been passed
before the decision of this Court in the case of 
Assistant
Commercial Taxes Officer vs. Bajaj Electricals Limited
,
reported in 2009 (1) S.C.C.308.
 
Hence, the impugned order
is set aside and the matter is remitted to the High Court
for de novo consideration in the light of the decision of
this   Court,   if   applicable,      in       the   case   of   
Bajaj
Electricals Limited
 [supra].


        The civil appeal is, accordingly, allowed with no
order as to costs.
