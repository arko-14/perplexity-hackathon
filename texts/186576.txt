       (ARISING OUT OF CC NOS. 4610-4613/2010)


Sawaran Lata etc.                               ..Petitioners

     Versus

State of Haryana & Ors.                         ...Respondents


                          ORDER



Dr. B.S. CHAUHAN, J.





1.   These special leave petitions reveal a very sorry state of

affair and make it evident that litigants are eager to abuse the

process of the Court, having no idea for the law of

limitation/delay and laches.





2.   These special leave petitions have been filed against the

judgment and order of the Punjab and Haryana High Court

dated 30.5.2009 by which the Civil Writ Petition Nos.8794 of
2009 and 8761 of 2009 have been dismissed only on the

ground of delay. The Review Petitions were filed which were

also time barred by 48 days. The same stood dismissed vide

order dated 25.9.2009.    These special leave petitions have

been filed with an inordinate delay of 172 days.    Petitioners

sought relief of quashing the land acquisition proceedings in

respect of which the award had been made under 
Section 11


of the Land Acquisition Act, 1894 (hereinafter called as "Act

1894") on 27.4.2004.





3.   The facts and circumstances giving rise to these petitions

are that the respondent - State of Haryana issued a

notification under 
Section 4
 of Act 1894 in respect of a huge

chunk of land including some land of the petitioners on 2nd

May, 2001. Substance of the said notification was published

in two newspapers on 5.5.2001.     The respondents issued a

declaration under 
Section 6
 of Act 1894 on 30.4.2002 and the

substance thereof was also published in local newspapers

immediately thereafter. The Land Acquisition Collector made

an award on 27.4.2004 and in pursuance thereof, the



                                                            2

respondents took possession of the land and removed the trees

from the land of the petitioners.





4.   Petitioners approached the High Court by filing Writ

Petition Nos. 8794/2009 and 8761/2009 on 28.5.2009

praying for quashing the notification dated 2.5.2001 under


Section 4
 and declaration dated 30.4.2002 under 
Section 6
 of

Act 1894. The High Court dismissed both the petitions on the

ground of delay observing that the award under 
Section 11
 of

Act 1894 had already been made on 27.4.2004.               Being

aggrieved, petitioners filed Review Petitions with 48 days' delay

which have also been dismissed vide order dated 25.9.2009.

These petitions have been filed with 172 days' delay. There is

further delay of 37 days' in re-filing of the same.




5.   The issue involved in these petitions is as to whether the

acquisition proceedings can be challenged at a belated stage.

The issue is no more res integra as the issue has been

considered by this Court time and again.





                                                              3


6.   When a person challenges 
Section 4
 Notification on any

ground, it should be challenged within a reasonable period,

and if the acquisition is challenged at a belated stage, the

petition deserves to be dismissed only on this count. (Vide

Hari Singh & Ors. Vs. State of U.P., AIR 1984 SC 1020).





7.   A Constitution Bench of this Court, in 
Aflatoon & Ors.

Vs. Lt. Governor, Delhi & Ors.
 AIR 1974 SC 2077, while

dealing with the issue, observed as under:-


     ".... to have sat on the fence and allowed the
     government to complete the acquisition on the
     basis that notification under 
Section 4
 and the
     declaration under 
Section 6
 were valid and
     then to attack the notification on the grounds
     which were available to them at the time when
     the notification was published, would be
     putting a premium of dilatory tactics. The writ
     petitions are liable to be dismissed on the
     ground of laches and delay on the part of the
     petitioner."



8.   Same view has been reiterated by this Court observing

that acquisition proceedings should be challenged before the

same attain finality, in 
State of Mysore Vs. V.K. Kangan

9.   
In 
Municipal Corporation of Greater Bombay Vs.

Industrial Development Investment Co. Pvt. Ltd. & Ors.


AIR 1997 SC 482, this Court observed as under:-


          "If the interested person allows the grass
     to grow under his feet by allowing the
     acquisition proceedings to go on and reach its
     terminus in the award and possession is taken
     in furtherance thereof and vest in the State
     free from all encumbrances, the slumbered
     interested person would be told off the
     gates of the Court that his grievance should
     not be entertained when there is inordinate
     delay in filing the writ petition and when all
     steps taken in the acquisition proceedings
     have become final, the Court should be loath
     to quash the notifications. (Emphasis added)





                                                       5


 
10.   Similar view has been reiterated in 
State of Rajasthan &

Ors. Vs. D.R. Laxmi & Ors.
, (1996) 6 SCC 445, wherein this

Court has held that even the void proceedings need not be set

at naught if the party has not approached the Court within

reasonable time, as judicial review is not permissible at a

belated stage. This Court held as under:






      "......Delay in challenging the notification was
      fatal and writ petition entails with dismissal on
      grounds of laches. It is thus, well-settled law
      that when there is inordinate delay in filing the
      writ petition and when all steps taken in the
      acquisition proceedings have become final, the
      Court should be loathe to quash the
      notifications........The order or action, if ultra
      vires the power, becomes void and it does
      not confer any right. But the action need
      not necessarily be set at naught in all
      events. Though the order may be void, if
      the party does not approach the Court
      within reasonable time, which is always a
      question of fact and have the order
      invalidated or acquiesced or waived, the
      discretion of the Court has to be exercised
      in a reasonable manner. When the discretion
      has been conferred on the Court, the Court
      may in appropriate case decline to grant the
      relief, even if it holds that the order was void.
      The net result is that extraordinary jurisdiction
      of the Court may not be exercised in such
      circumstances." (Emphasis Added)





                                                           6


 
11.   Similar view has been reiterated by this Court in


Northern Indian Glass Industries Vs. Jaswant Singh & Ors.


AIR 2003 SC 234;        and   
Haryana    State   Handloom     &

Handicrafts Corporation Ltd. Vs. Jain School Society
 AIR

2004 SC 850.






12.   In the instant case, it is not the case of the petitioners

that they had not been aware of acquisition proceedings as the

only ground taken in the writ petition has been that substance

of the notification under 
Section 4
 and declaration under


Section 6
 of Act 1894 had been published in the newspapers

having no wide circulation. Even if, the submission made by

the petitioners is accepted, it cannot be presumed that they

could not be aware of acquisition proceedings for the reason

that very huge chunk of land belonging to large number of

tenure holders had been notified for acquisition. Therefore, it

should have been a talk of the town. Thus, it cannot be

presumed that petitioners could not have knowledge of the

acquisition proceedings.





                                                             7


13.   In such circumstances, we do not find any fault with the

impugned judgment and order. The petitions are dismissed on

the ground of delay.
