RESPONDENTS


                         JUDGMENT



HARJIT SINGH BEDI,J.



1.   We had heard the petitioner-in-person at length.        Although
this is a miscellaneous matter and at the stage of fresh hearing, we
had reserved judgment for the reason that the petitioner was
surcharged   and   appeared   to   be   emotionally    disturbed   and
prudence dictated that we should not make any order adverse to
her in her presence.



2.   During the course of arguments, the petitioner repeatedly
referred to the fact that she had been sexually intimidated by her
senior colleagues in office and that they had misused their
positions and amassed huge fortunes. She also emphasized that it
was on account of her attempts to highlight the misconduct of
these officers that she had been harassed & hounded time and
again and had even been denied her service dues.



3.   We have gone through the petition as also the documents
filed and find that the allegations made by the petitioner have been
enquired into by several independent bodies including a Committee
headed by Dr. Renuka Vishwanathan and supervised by the

                                  2

Cabinet Secretary and that no merit had been found in the
allegations levelled by her.

                                              WP (Crl.) No.60/2009


4.    The record further shows that the allegations made by the
petitioner have at one time or the other been examined by the
National Human Rights Commission and the National Commission
for Women and they too had not granted her any relief.



5.    We also see from paragraph No.18 of the petition that some
over-lapping matters are pending before the Delhi High Court.             For
all these reasons, we are unable to grant any relief to the petitioner
under 
Article 32
 of the Constitution of India.     She may however
pursue her remedies before the Delhi High Court or elsewhere.



6.    The Writ Petition is dismissed for the above reasons.
