                          CRIMINAL APPEAL NOS.693-696 OF 2002

STATE OF MAHARASHTRA                                               ... APPELLANT(S)

                     VERSUS

                                            O R D E R



                         Heard learned counsel for the State.

 
The State is aggrieved by the judgment of the High Court
in Criminal Appeal Nos.622/1994, 643/1994, 649/1994 and 82/1995 on
the   file    of     the   High     Court      of    Bombay   wherein       the   accused      were
acquitted.         The main reason for such acquittal was on the basis of
the interpretation           of   Section       42     of   the    N.D.P.S.Act.         When    the
matters      came    up    before       this    Court,      this    Court    by   order      dated
13.07.2006,        adjourned      the    matters       awaiting      the    decision    on     this
issue by the Constitution Bench and the issue was finally decided by
the   Constitution          Bench    in     Criminal        Appeal     No.36/2003       entitled

Karnail Singh Vs. State of Haryana
, reported in 2009(8) SCC p.539.
In this view of the fact, we allow the appeals and set aside the
judgment of the High Court and request the High Court to re-hear the
appeal.      The    High    Court    may       issue    fresh      notices   to   the    accused
initially.         The Criminal Appeals are allowed accordingly.
