                              STATE OF M.P.
                     (Criminal Appeal No. 956 of 2005)
                            JANUARY 12, 2010
                  [Harjit Singh Bedi and J.M. Panchal, JJ.]

                              2010(1) SCR 1063
   The following Order of the Court was delivered

                                   ORDER



   The facts leading to the appeal are as under :



   At about 4.00 P.M. on 8th July, 1987 the prosecutrix (PW-1) was alone in
her house situated in Village Magrohar, Police Station Rampur Naiken. The
appellant, who was known to her, entered the house and after having inflicted
three tangi blows on her head and hands, raped her. The prosecutrix also, in
defence, snatched the tangi from the appellant and caused several injuries on
his head while he was leaving the room. As a result of the injuries suffered,
both became unconscious. In the meanwhile, Sampat the husband of the
prosecutrix, arrived at the scene and she told him about what had happened.
She also called Babulal (PW-2) her son and Shivbalak (PW-3) a distant
relative, and they along with several other persons reached the spot. The
prosecutrix thereafter accompanied by her husband Sampat, Babulal and the
others afore referred lodged the First Information Report (Exhibit P-1) at
Police Chowki Khaddi on the same day at about 7.30 p.m. The prosecutrix
was also sent for a medical examination which was carried out the next day
by Dr. Kalpana Ravi (PW-5), who found three injuries on her and further
recorded that as she was a married woman of 42 years, it had not been
possible to give a categoric opinion about any recent sexual encounter. The
appellant was also examined by Dr. S.B. Khare (PW-6) and his report Ex. P-
6/A revealed six injuries, several of them on the head including Injury No. 6,
which was grievous as his teeth had been knocked out. On the completion of
the investigation a charge for offences punishable under 
Sections 376
, 
323

and 
506
 of the Indian Penal Code was framed. The appellant denied the
charge and was brought to trial. During the course of the trial, PWs 2 and 3,
Babulal and Shivbalak the son and relative of the prosecutrix who had
reached the place of incident, soon after the alleged rape, were declared
hostile and they gave a version contrary to what had been deposed to by the
prosecutrix. The trial court also found, endorsing the view of Dr. Kalpana Ravi
(PW-5), that as the prosecutrix was a married woman, it was impossible to
give a categoric opinion about any recent sexual intercourse but relying on
the sole testimony, of the prosecutrix, sentenced the appellant to undergo
rigorous imprisonment for 10 years under 
Section 376
 of Indian Penal Code
and to other terms of imprisonment for the other offences. The High Court
dismissed the appeal and confirmed the sentence. The matter is before us
after the grant of special leave.



    The learned counsel for the appellant has raised three arguments during
the course of hearing. He has first pointed out that the two primary witnesses,
both relatives of the prosecutrix, including Babulal her son had been declared
hostile and had not supported the prosecutrix's case and as the story
preferred by her was far fetched, it could not be believed. It has also been
submitted that the medical evidence which could be a corroborating factor,
too was uncertain, as Dr. Kalpana Ravi had stated that the factum of rape
could not be ascertained. The learned counsel has finally emphasised that
the defence version that the appellant had reached the house of the
prosecutrix to recover his cow and in a quarrel between them that followed,
both had suffered injuries and that he had thereafter been falsely implicated
in a case of rape. To highlight this argument, the learned counsel has referred
us to the medical evidence of Dr. S.B. Khare (PW-6).



 
Mr. C.D. Singh, the learned counsel for the respondent State has
however submitted that the prosecutrix case was liable to be believed and
has relied upon the judgment of this court in in [
Motilal vs. State of Madhya
Pradesh
] 2008 SCC (Vol.11) 20. It has also been submitted that the evidence
clearly showed that the appellant had been arrested from the house of the
prosecutrix which proved the factum of rape.




   We have heard the learned counsel for the parties at length. We find that
this case is rather an unusual one. The fact that the appellant was in the
house of the prosecutrix is admitted on both sides. The prosecution story that
the appellant a young man of 31 years had been overpowered by a much
older woman is rather difficult to believe. The injuries received by the
appellant are given below :-



    1.    Parted wound, whose shape is 1.5 c.m. X 1/5 c.m. on the right side
          of the hand.



    2.    Swelled injury, whose shape is 1.5 c.m. X 1 inch, which is on the
          upper side of the right hand.



    3.    Swelled injury, whose shape is 1/2" X 1/2", which is on the elbow of
          the left hand.



          The injury of accused are given below :-



    1.    Parted wound, whose shape is 1 = inch X 1/2 c.m. X 1 c.m. on the
          middle of the head.



    2.    Parted wound, whose shape is 1" X 1/2 c.m. X 3 m.m. on the front
          side of the head.



    3.    Parted wound, whose shape is 1/2" X 1/2" c.m. X 3 m.m. on the
          right of the head.



     4.   Swelled injury, whose shape is 1/2" X 1/2".



    5.    Swelled injury, whose shape is 1" X 1/2" on the chin.



    6.    Two central incisers tooth and right canine tooth of upper jaw were
          broken and the enamles were swelled.



   Injury No. 6 is a grievous one. As per the prosecutrix she had caused
these injuries to the appellant during the time of rape and thereafter that the
accused had caused her three minorinjuries as well whereas the case of the
appellant is that he had gone to her house to recover his cow and in a quarrel
that followed both had received injuries. In any case as the investigating
officer had not verified the statement of the appellant some corroboration for
the prosecutrix's story was required. As already mentioned, her son Babulal
and Shivbalak, a relative, who had reached the place of incident, were both
declared hostile and did not support the prosecutrix. We find that even her
husband Sampat who had accompanied her to the police station to lodge the
report did not come into the witness box and the doctor was also unable to
confirm the factum of rape.



 
Mr. C.D. Singh has however placed reliance on 
Moti Lal
's case (supra) to
contend that the evidence of the prosecutrix was liable to be believed save in
exceptional circumstances. There can be no quarrel with this proposition (and
it has been so emphasised by this Court time and again) but to hold that a
prosecutrix must be believed irrespective of the improbabilities in her story, is
an argument that can never be accepted. The test always is as to whether the
given story prima facie inspires confidence. We are of the opinion that the
present matter is indeed an exceptional one.




    As already mentioned above, in our opinion, the story given by the prosecutrix
does not inspire confidence. We thus allow this appeal, set aside the impugned
judgments and direct that the appellant be acquitted.
