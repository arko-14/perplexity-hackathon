Bench: 
B.S. Chauhan
, 
J.M. Panchal


                                  IN THE SUPREME COURT OF INDIA
                        CIVIL APPELLATE JURISDICTION

                      CIVIL APPEAL NO. 3065 OF 2010
                [arising out of SLP(C) No. 22139 of 2008]

KERALA ELECTRICAL & ALLIED ENGINEERING          .....               APPELLANTS



                                      VERSUS

GEN. SEC. KER. EMPLOYEES ASSN. (AITUC)          .....           RESPONDENTS
& ORS.




                                  O R D E R



    1.    Leave      granted.   Appeal admitted.


    2.    Heard the learned counsel for the parties.


    3.    The two workmen through the respondent-Union had

    claimed benefit under the Kerala Casual Temporary and

    Badli Workers (Wages) Act, 1989.           Though in the claim

    petition,   it     was   stated    that    they    were    regular

    employees, the competent authority and the appellate

    authority   constituted     under    the    Act    came    to    the

    conclusion that they were only casual labourers and

    were entitled to the benefit conferred by Section 3 of

    the said Act. That decision has been upheld by the

    learned Single Judge and in appeal by the Division

    Bench of the High Court of Kerala at Ernakulam.


    4.    The   only    contention    which    was    raised   by    the

    learned counsel for the appellant was that the two
workmen were permanent employees and therefore, Section

3 of the said Act was not applicable at all.         As

observed earlier, the competent authority as well as

the appellate authority constituted under the Act have

on appreciation of evidence held that the two workmen

were causal labourers and, therefore, were entitled to

benefit under Section 3 of the Act.   This finding is a

finding of fact.   The Court does not find any merit in

the appeal and therefore it must fail.     Accordingly,

the appeal is dismissed. There shall be no order as to

costs.
