Bezawada Bar Assn.Tr.President vs Soumya Misra & Ors on 18 January, 2010


Bench: 
Harjit Singh Bedi
, 
J.M. Panchal


                                IN THE SUPREME COURT OF INDIA

                     CRIMINAL APPELLATE JURISDICTION

                    CRIMINAL APPEAL NO. 130 OF 2010
                [Arising out of SLP(Crl) No.7045/2007]

BEZAWADA BAR         ASSOCIATION         THRO'                 .......APPELLANT(S)
PRESIDENT

                                                     Versus

SOUMYA MISRA & ORS.                                             .....RESPONDENT(S)


                                    O R D E R



                     Leave granted.



2.                   The matter has a chequered history.                           This

matter had earlier come to this Court at the instance of

the State of Andhra Pradesh challenging the order of the

High     Court       whereby       it     had        virtually       scuttled      the

proceedings against the respondent herein who happens to be

a senior police officer.                 In accordance with the order of

this Court dated 5/11/2001, the Magistrate was directed to

proceed       with   the   enquiry       under       
Section    202
   Cr.P.C.       and

thereafter proceed further in accordance with law.                                  The

accused       thereupon    filed        Criminal       Petition     No.     4928/2006

under 
Section 482
 Cr.P.C. praying that the proceedings that

had    been    initiated      by   the     appellant          Bar   Association      be

quashed.       The High Court, in paragraph 8 and 9, has held as

under:



                 "8.       The present case was filed with an
       ulterior      motive    for       wreaking       vengeance      on    the
       accused and with        a        view    to    spite     them due to
.....2.

    private          and     personal       grudge.              Though   the
    complainant alleged that they entered into the
    Bar Association with plain clothes, he did not
    mention as to what was the motive for the accused
    to     confront          with     the    members        of      the   Bar
    Association and to register a false case against
    them.



                9.          By   taking     into     consideration        the
    sequence of the events, the delay in filing the
    complaint, the non-explanation by the complainant
    whether       the      police     officers       can    be    prosecuted
    without       any       sanction    order      under     
Section      197

    Cr.P.C. And the non-explanation of the motive for
    the accused to foist a case against the member of
    the    Bar       Association       by   entering        into    the   Bar
    Association            premises    without       the    commission     of
    the offence, I am of the view that the facts of
    the        present       comes      within        the     purview      of
    illustration No.7 in the Judgment of the Supreme
    Court in Bhajan Lal's case (1 supra), therefore,
    the        proceedings       against       the     petitioners        are
    liable to be quashed."



We are of the opinion that the finding referred to above

could not have been recorded without evidence and as a

matter of fact, the High Court has examined the matter as

if it was doing so after the completion of a trial. We find

absolutely no basis in the High Court's observations that

there    was    an ulterior         motive for       taking       vengeance with
.....3.

the   members   of   the   Bar    Association     or   that   the   Bar

Association had not been able to give any explanation as to

why the respondent herein would lodge a false case against

them and whether the respondent could be prosecuted without

sanction under Section 197 Cr.P.C.





3.              We are, therefore, of the view that the High

Court order cannot be sustained.          It is accordingly quashed

and   set   aside.     The   appeal       is   allowed.       Necessary

consequences will follow.
