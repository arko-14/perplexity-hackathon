                                ORDER



         On 18th December, 2008, when some of the cases in the present

batch came for hearing before a Division Bench of this Court to which one

of us, Kapadia, J., was a party, the Division Bench of this Court found that

some of the High Courts before which the State Entry Tax stood challenged

                                                                                   8


had taken the view that clause (a) and clause (b) of 
Article 304
 of the

Constitution of India are independent of each other and that if the impugned

law stood saved under 
Article 304(a)
 then it need not be tested with

reference to clause (b) for determining its validity. Accordingly, on that date,

the Division Bench of this Court referred to the Constitution Bench 10

questions, the most important of which being - whether the State enactments

relating to levy of entry tax have to be tested with reference to both 
Article

304(a)
 and 
Article 304(b)
 of the Constitution and whether 
Article 304(a)
 is

conjunctive with or separate from 
Article 304(b)?
 Consequently, the matter

stood referred to the Constitution Bench of this Court.




 
Accordingly, on 16th March, 2010, the entire batch of cases came

for hearing before the Constitution Bench in which the lead matter is 
Jindal

Stainless Ltd. & Anr. v. State of Haryana & Ors.. When
 the hearing

commenced before the Constitution Bench, we found that the assessees

(original petitioners in the High Courts) are heavily relying upon the tests

propounded by a 5-Judge Bench of this Court in 
Atiabari Tea Co. Ltd. v.

The State of Assam and Ors.
, (1961) 1 SCR 809, which tests subject to the

clarification, stood reiterated in the subsequent judgment delivered by a

larger Bench of this Court in the case of 
The Automobile Transport

(Rajasthan) Ltd. v. The State of Rajasthan and Ors.
, (1963) 1 SCR 491.


In fact, it may be stated that the Constitution Bench of this Court delivered

the judgment in 
Atiabari Tea Co. Ltd.
 (supra) on 26th September, 1960. Soon

                                                                                  9


thereafter, on 4th April, 1961, after hearing arguments in full, a 5-Judge

Bench of this Court came to the conclusion that the matter needs to be

referred to a larger Bench.
 
In the circumstances, a 7-Judge Bench of this

Court decided the matter in 
Automobile Transport (Rajasthan) Ltd.
 (supra)

on 9th April, 1962 reiterating the tests 
laid down in
 
Atiabari
's case (supra)

subject to one clarification.






The question, therefore, which we need to answer, in the first instance,

before going into the validity of each of the State Laws impugned before us

is - Whether after 49 years, this Court should revisit the tests propounded in

the earlier decisions in the case of 
Atiabari Tea Co. Ltd. and Automobile

Transport (Rajasthan) Ltd.
 (supra)?
 
At this stage, it may be mentioned that

the States whose Entry Tax Laws have been challenged have contended

before us that the tests propounded in 
Atiabari Tea Co. Ltd. and Automobile

Transport (Rajasthan) Ltd.
 (supra) have failed to strike a balance between

the "freedom of trade and commerce" under 
Article 301
 of the Constitution

and the States' authority to levy taxes under 
Articles 245
 and 
246
 of the

Constitution read with the appropriate Legislative Entries in the Seventh

Schedule to the Constitution of India.
 
The states, therefore, sought revisiting

of the aforestated two decisions in 
Atiabari Tea Co. Ltd. and Automobile

Transport (Rajasthan) Ltd.
 (supra) by a larger Bench.


                                                                                    10


 
In 
Keshav Mills Co. Ltd. v. Commissioner of Income-tax,

Bombay North
, (1965) 2 SCR 908 at p. 921, a Constitution Bench of this

Court enacted circumstances in which a reference to the larger Bench would

lie. It was held that in revisiting and revising its earlier decision, this Court

should ask itself whether in the interest of the public good or for any other

valid and compulsive reasons, it is necessary that the earlier decision should

be revised? Whether on the earlier occasion, did some patent aspects of the

question remain unnoticed, or was the attention of the Court not drawn to

any relevant and material statutory provision, or was any previous decision

bearing on the point not noticed? What was the impact of the error in the

previous decision on public good? Has the earlier decision been followed on

subsequent occasions either by this Court or by the High Courts? And,

would the reversal of the earlier decision lead to public inconvenience,

hardship or mischief?
 
According to the judgment in 
Keshav Mills
 case these

and other relevant considerations must be born in mind whenever this Court

is called upon to exercise its jurisdiction to review and revisit its earlier

decisions.
 
Of course, in 
Keshav Mills
 case a caution was sounded to the

effect that frequent exercise of this Court of its power to revisit its earlier

decisions may incidentally tend to make the law uncertain and introduce

confusion which must be avoided. But, that is not to say that if on a

subsequent occasion, the Court is satisfied that its earlier decision was

clearly erroneous, it should hesitate to correct the error.
 
In conclusion, in


Keshav Mills
 case, this Court observed that it is not possible to lay down any

                                                                                11


principles which should govern the approach of the Court in dealing with the

question of revisiting its earlier decision. It would ultimately depend upon

several relevant considerations.






 
In the case of 
Central Board of Dawoodi Bohra Community

and Anr. v. State of Maharashtra and Anr.
, (2005) 2 SCC 673, a

Constitution Bench of this Court observed that, in case of doubt, a smaller

Bench can invite attention of Chief Justice and request for the matter being

placed for hearing before a Bench larger than the one whose decision is

being doubted.






 
Applying the tests 
laid down in
 the aforestated two cases, i.e.,


Keshav Mills Co. Ltd. and Central Board of Dawoodi Bohra Community


(supra), we find that on number of aspects a larger Bench of this Court needs

to revisit the interpretation of Part XIII of the Constitution including the

various tests propounded in the judgments of the Constitution Bench of this

Court in the aforestated two cases, namely, 
Atiabari Tea Co. and Automobile

Transport (Rajasthan) Ltd.
 (supra).    Some of these aspects which need

consideration by larger Bench of this Court may be briefly enumerated.

Interplay/interrelationship between 
Article 304(a)
 and 
Article 304(b).
 The

significance of the word "and" between 
Article 304(a)
 and 
304(b).
 The

significance of the non obstante clause in 
Article 304.
 The balancing of

freedom of trade and commerce in 
Article 301
 vis-`-vis the States' authority

to levy taxes under 
Article 245
 and 
Article 246
 of the Constitution read with

                                                                                12


the appropriate legislative Entries in the Seventh Schedule, particularly in

the context of movement of trade and commerce. Whether 
Article 304(a)


and 
Article 304(b)
 deal with different subjects? Whether the impugned

taxation law to be valid under 
Article 304(a)
 must also fulfil the conditions

mentioned in 
Article 304(b)
, including Presidential assent? Whether the

word "restrictions" in 
Article 302
 and in 
Article 304(b)
 includes tax laws?

Whether validity of a law impugned as violative of 
Article 301
 should be

judged only in the light of the test of non-discrimination? Does 
Article 303


circumscribe 
Article 301?
 Whether "internal goods" would come under


Article 304(b)
 and "external goods" under 
Article 304(a)?
 
Whether "per se

test" propounded in 
Atiabari
's case (supra) should or should not be rejected?

Whether tax simpliciter constitutes a restriction under Part XIII of the

Constitution? Whether the word "restriction" in 
Article 304(b)
 includes tax

laws? Is taxation justiciable? Whether the "working test
" 
laid down in


Atiabari makes a tax law per se violative of 
Article 301?
 Inter-relationship

between 
Article 19(1)(g)
 and 
Article 301
 of the Constitution?
 
These are

some of the questions which warrant reconsideration of the judgments in


Atiabari Tea Co. Ltd and Automobile Transport (Rajasthan) Ltd.
 (supra) by

a larger Bench of this Court.






 
In conclusion, we may also mention that though the judgments in


Atiabari Tea Co. Ltd. and Automobile Transport (Rajasthan) Ltd.
 (supra)

came to be delivered 49 years ago, a doubt was expressed about the tests 
laid

down in
 those two judgments even in the year 1975 in the case of 
G.K.

                                                                                    13


Krishnan and Ors. v. State of Tamil Nadu and Ors.
, (1975) 1 SCC 375

by Mathew, J., vide para 27, which reads as under:






         "Whether the restrictions visualized by 
Article 304(b)

         would include the levy of a non-discriminatory tax is a
         matter on which there is scope for difference of opinion.
         
Article 304(a)
 prohibits only imposition of a
         discriminatory tax. It is not clear from the article that a
         tax simpliciter can be treated as a restriction on the
         freedom of internal trade. 
Article 304(a)
 is intended to
         prevent discrimination against imported goods by
         imposing on them tax at a higher rate than that borne
         by goods produced in the State. A discriminatory tax
         against outside goods is not a tax simpliciter but is a
         barrier to trade and commerce. 
Article 304
 itself makes
         a distinction between tax and restriction. That apart,
         taxing powers of the Union and States are separate and
         mutually exclusive. It is rather strange that power to tax
         given to States, say, for instance, under Entry 54 of List
         II to pass a law imposing tax on sale of goods should
         depend upon the goodwill of the Union Executive."

 
(emphasis supplied)




         For the aforestated reasons, let this batch of cases be put before

Hon'ble Chief Justice of India for constituting a suitable larger Bench for

reconsideration of the judgments of this Court in 
Atiabari Tea Co. and

Automobile Transport (Rajasthan) Ltd.
 (supra).
