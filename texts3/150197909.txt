                       CRIMINAL APPEAL NO. 613 OF 2011

                                     O R D E R



            Leave granted.



            We have heard learned counsel for the parties.
            It is not disputed that the appellant in each case is 

in jail from November, 2009.  On consideration of the totality 

of   the   facts   and   circumstances   of   these   cases,   we   deem   it 

appropriate  to release  the appellant  in each  case on  bail on 

furnishing   personal   bond   for   a   sum   of   Rs.50,000/-   with   two 

sureties   of   the   like   amount   each   to   the   satisfaction   of   the 

Trial Court. 



            However,   in   the   facts   and     circumstances   of   these 

cases,   we   direct   the   Trial   Court   to   conclude   the   trial   as 

expeditiously as possible and the Trial Court would not grant 

any adjournments unless it becomes absolutely imperative.



                              : 2 :


           With this observation, the appeals are disposed of.
