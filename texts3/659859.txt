SURENDRA KOLI                             .........Appellant (s)

                             Versus

           SPECIAL LEAVE PETITION (CRL.) 608 of 2010



                         O R D E R 



        Heard   Dr.   Sushil   Balwada,   learned   counsel,   who   has 

appeared for the appellant Surendra Koli in Criminal Appeal 

No. 2227 of 2010.  



        The   appellant   Surendra   Koli,   accused   no.   2   and 

Maninder   Singh   Pandher   accused   no.   1   were   convicted   under 


Section 302
/
364
/
376
 IPC by the   Special Sessions trial no. 

611   of   2007   decided   on   13.02.2009   by   Additional   Sessions 

Judge, Ghaziabad, U.P.  By that judgment death sentence was 

imposed on both these accused.



        In   Appeal/Reference   to   the   High   Court   accused 

Surendra   Koli's   death   sentence   was   affirmed   while   the 

accused   Maninder   Singh   Pandher   was   acquitted.     Hence, 

Surendra Koli has filed this Appeal before us.  


        The facts of this case are gruesome and horrifying. 

It seems that several children had gone missing over 2 years 


from   Sector   31,   Nithari   Village,   Gautam   Budh   Nagar,   Noida 

from 2005 onwards.  Several of such children were alleged to


                                   -1-


                                   -2-


have   been   killed   by   the   appellant   who   is   also   alleged   to 

have   chopped   and   eaten   the   body   parts   after   cooking   them. 

Appellant   Surendra   Koli   was   the   servant   of   accused   no.   1 

Moninder Singh, and they lived together at D-5, Sector 31, 

Noida. 



           The   High   Court   in   the   impugned   judgment   dated 

11.09.2009 has discussed the evidence in great detail and we 

have   carefully   perused   the   same.     It   is   not   necessary 

therefore to again repeat all the facts which have been set 

out   in   the     judgment   of   the   High   Court   except   where 

necessary.  We entirely agree with the findings, conclusion 

and sentence of the High Court so far as accused Surendra 

Koli is concerned.  



           Admittedly, there was a confession made by Surendra 

Koli   before   the   Magistrate   under   
Section   164
   Cr.PC   on 

01.03.2007   and   we   are   satisfied   that   it   was   a   voluntary 

confession.     The   Magistrate   repeatedly   told   the   accused 

Surendra Koli that he was not bound to make the statement 

and   it   can   be   read     against   him.     In   our   opinion   the 

provisions of 
Section 164
 CrPC have been fully complied with 

while recording the said statement.  



           In   the   aforesaid   statement   before   the   Magistrate 

appellant Surendra Koli has admitted in great detail how he 


used to kill the girls after luring them inside the House 

no.   D-5,   Sector   31,   Noida   by   strangulating   them,   and   he 

would then chop up and eat up their body parts after cooking 

them.  Some body parts, clothes and slippers were thrown in





                                  -3-


the   enclosed   gallery   behind   the   house   at   D-5,   Sector   31, 

Noida.     He   volunteered   to   lead   the   police   team   to   the 

specific   spot   where   he   had   kept   the   articles/body   parts 

hidden.   The police party reached that spot along with the 

appellant.   On his pointing out, 15 skulls and bones were 

recovered, and also a knife was recovered from a water tank 

of a bath room in D-5, Sector 31. On 31.12.2006 during the 

scooping of the drain in front of D-5, bones and chappals 

were recovered.  



        He   has   given   graphic   description   about   the   several 

murders he has committed.  Surendra Koli was the servant of 

co-accused   Maninder   Singh   Pandher   as   has   been   admitted   by 

him.  The confession under 
Section 164
 has been corroborated 

in material particulars.  The body parts of the killed girls 

have been found in the gallery behind the house and in  the 

Nala beside the house.  



        Weapons   like   knife   have   also   been   recovered.     The 

girls clothes have also been identified.  


        Two   girls     PW-27   namely   Pratibha   and   PW-28   namely 

Purnima   have   stated   before   the   trial   Court   that   they   were 

also attempted to be lured inside the House D-5 by Surendra 


Koli but they refused to enter the house.   This was their 

sheer good luck, for if they would have entered the house 

then   they   might   have   met   the   same   fate.     Their   evidence 

indicates the modus operandi of the appellant. 


        The parents of one Rimpa Haldar had filed a missing 

report   at   the   police   station   on   20.07.2005   stating   that 

their  daughter  Rimpa  aged  about  15 years had gone to do





                                  -4-


menial work in Sector 20 on 08.02.2005 but had not returned. 

Smt Doli Haldar came to know that in D-5, Sector 31 human 

skeleton and clothes had been found.   Hence she went there 

and identified the chunni and bra of her daughter.  


        The   appellant   was   charged   for   the   murder   of   Rimpa 

(amongst   others),   and   was   found   guilty   by   both   the   trial 

Court   and   High   Court.     Although   it   is   a   case   of 

circumstantial   evidence   we   are   of   the   opinion   that   the 

entire   chain   of   circumstances   connecting   the   accused 

Surendra   Koli   with   the   crime   has   been   established   by   the 

prosecution beyond reasonable doubt.  


        The DNA test of Rimpa   by CDFD, a pioneer institute 

in Hyderabad matched with that of blood of her parents and 

brother.   The Doctors at AIIMS have put the   parts of the 

deceased girls  which have been recovered by the Doctors of 

AIIMS   together.     These   bodies   have   been   recovered   in   the 

presence of the Doctors of AIIMS at the  pointing out by the 

accused Surendra Koli.   Thus, recovery is admissible under 



Section 27
 of the Evidence Act. 



 
On   the   facts   of   the   case   we   see   no   reason   to 

interfere with the findings of the trial court and the High 

Court   that   the   appellant   Surendra   Koli   is   guilty   of 

murdering   Rimpa   Haldar.   Both   Courts   have   gone   into   the 

evidence in great detail and we have perused the same.  The 

appellant appears to be a serial killer, and  these cases in 

our opinion fall within the category of rarest of the rare 

cases as laid down in 
Bachan singh  Vs State of Punjab
, 1982 

SCC   689   which   has   been   subsequently   followed   in   
Atbir   Vs  

Government of NCT of Delhi
, 2010 SCC (9) 1.


                                  -5-


        The   killings   by   the   appellant   Surendra   Koli   are 

horrifying and barbaric.  He used a definite methodology in 

committing these murders.  He would see small girls passing 

by   the   house,   and   taking   advantage   of   their   weakness   lure 

them inside the house no. D-5, Sector 31, Nithari Village, 

Noida and there he would strangulate them and after killing 

them he tried to have sex with the body and would then cut 

off their body parts and eat them.   Some parts of the body 

were   disposed   off   by   throwing   them   in   the   passage   gallery 

and drain (nala) beside the house.  House no. D-5, Sector 31 

had   become   a   virtual   slaughter   house,   where   innocent 

children were regularly butchered.  



        In   our   opinion,   this   case   clearly   falls   within   the 

category of rarest of rare case and no mercy can be shown to 

the appellant Surendra Koli.  





       The appeal is, therefore, dismissed.
