              1.   This appeal by way of special leave arises out of 

              the following facts:



                                Balbir   Kaur,   the   deceased,   was   married   with 

              Nachhattar   Singh   appellant   about   five   years   prior   to 

              the date of occurrence.  Out of the wedlock, the couple 

              bore   a   female   child.     About   2   or   3   years   after   the 

              marriage,   the   appellant   and   his   parents(the   three 

              accused)   started   making   demands   for   dowry   on   the 

              allegation   that   Balbir   Kaur's     parents   had   not   given 

              sufficient amounts at the time of marriage, but as the 

              demands could not be satisfied she was maltreated which 

              led   the   deceased   to   leave   the   matrimonial   home   on 

              several   occasions.     It   appears,   however,   that   on   the 

              intervention of well-wishers on both sides she returned

                                                                                                   2






              to   the   matrimonial   home.     The   ill-treatment   however, 

              continued   unabated   and   whenever   Balbir   Kaur's   brother 

              Sukhmander   Singh,   P.W.   6,   would   meet   her   she   would 

              complain that she was not being treated properly.   On 

              the   25th  December,   1987   at   about   7:00a.m.   information 

              with   regard   to   Balbir   Kaur's   unnatural   death   was 

              received   by   her   parents   on   which   Sukhmander   Singh, 

              P.W.,   along   with   other   family   members   rushed   to   the 

              house of the accused.  They saw Balbir Kaur lying dead 

              on   her   cot.       The   police   were   informed   and   a   First 

              Information Report was registered.   The dead body was 

              despatched   for   its   post   mortem   examination.     The 

              viscera   was   also   sent   to   the   Chemical   Examiner   who 

              rendered an opinion that the death had been caused by 

              poisoning.  A criminal complaint was also filed by P.W. 

              6   Sukhmander   Singh   against   the   appellant   in   the 

              meanwhile.     The   complaint   case   as   well   as   the   case 

              arising   out   of   the   First   Information   Report   were 

              clubbed   together   and   on   the   completion   of   the 

              investigation   a   charge   under   Section   302   read   with 

              
Section 34
 and 
304B
 IPC was framed against the accused. 


                                The prosecution relied primarily on the evidence 

              of   P.W.   6,   the   complainant,   P.W.   1,   Dr.   Yashpal   Garg 

              who   had   performed   the   post   mortem   of   the   dead   body, 

              P.W. 2 the Chemical Examiner and P.W. 7 Sajjan Singh, a

                                                                                                   3






              resident of Moga  who deposed to the demands for dowry 

              made   by   the   accused   even   a   day   before   the   incident. 

              The   prosecution   case   was   then   put   to   the   accused   and 

              they  denied  the  allegations  levelled  against  them  and 

              on   the   contrary   pleaded   that   as   Balbir   Kaur   was   a 

              qualified  Steno-typist  she  wanted  to  join  service  and 

              live   at   Moga   but   as   her   parents-in-law   were   old   they 

              had  insisted   that  she   stay  at   home  to   look  after   the 

              house hold chores and this frustration had led her into 

              a depression and finally to suicide.  The trial court, 

              on   a   consideration   of   the   evidence,   acquitted   the 

              accused for the offence punishable under 
Section 302
/
34
 

              of   the   Indian   Penal   Code   but   convicted   them   for   the 

              offence   punishable   under   
section   304B
   and   awarded   a 

              sentence of 7 years rigorous imprisonment.   An appeal 

              was   thereafter   filed   by   the   accused   before   the   High 

              Court.     The   High   court   partly   allowed   the   appeal 

              inasmuch that it held that a case under 
Section 304B
 of 

              the   IPC   was   not   made   out   but   the   accused   were 

              nonetheless liable to conviction under 
Section 306
 for 

              having abetted the suicide of Balbir Kaur.   The Court 

              found as a fact that there was absolutely no evidence 

              to show that Balbir Kaur's suicide was a dowry death as 

              the evidence with respect to the demands for dowry were 

              both vague and stale and could not form the basis for

              conviction.  This is what the Court had to say:


                                                    "Analysis   of   statements   of 
                                  prosecution   witnesses,   referred   to 
                                  above,                      clearly                         indicates                          that 
                                  allegations   regarding   demand   of   dowry 
                                  and   cruelty   inflicted   upon   the 
                                  deceased   are   in   general   terms   and 
                                  vague.     None   of   the   prosecution 
                                  witnesses   had   stated   as   to   when,   in 
                                  which year, date and month, any act of 
                                  cruelty   in   connection   with   demand   of 
                                  dowry   was   committed   by   any   fo   the 
                                  appellants against the deceased.   Not 
                                  even   a   single   witness   had   given   any 
                                  specific   instance   in   that   regard. 

                                  None   of   them   except   Sajjan   Singh   (PW 
                                  &) had stated that soon before death, 
                                  acts   of   cruelty   in   connection   with 
                                  demand of dowry were committed by the 
                                  appellants against the deceased."

                                The   Court   nevertheless   went   on   to   hold   that 

              though there were no specific instances of demands of 

              dowry   yet   an   inference   that   certain   demands   had   been 

              made was available from their testimony and the other 

              documentary   evidence   on   record   and   particularly,   that 

              no woman who had a young child would commit suicide (as 

              had happened in the present case) unless she had been 

              driven   to   it   by   the   ill   treatment   meted   out   to   her. 

              The   accused   were,   accordingly,   acquitted   of   the 

              offences   under   
Section   304B
   of   the   IPC   but   convicted 

              under   
Section   306
   IPC   and   awarded   a   sentence   of   four 

              years.    It  is   the  conceded   case  that   a  Special   Leave 

              Petition   filed   by   Nachhattar   Singh,   the   husband,   has 

              since   been   dismissed.     The   present   appeal   is   thus 

              confined   only   to   the   in-laws     i.e.   Nirmal   Singh   and

                                                                                                   5






              Harbans Kaur, the appellants before us.  


                                We   have   gone   through   the   evidence   as   also   the 

              reasons   given   by   the   High   Court   to   arrive   at   its 

              conclusions.     It   will   be   seen   that   the   allegations 

              against   the   accused   were   that   they   had   driven   the 

              deceased   to   suicide   on   account   of   cruelty   which 

              included   demands   for   dowry.     The   High   Court   has 

              rejected the story about the demands for dowry but has 

              drawn   an   inference   that   there   must   have   been   some 

              cruelty   which   had   forced   a   young   woman   to   suicide 

              despite the fact that she had a young child.   We find 

              that in the background of the findings recorded while 

              acquitting the accused of the charge under 
Section 304B
 

              of the IPC, no inferences or presumptions can be drawn. 

              Moreover, a perusal of 
Section 498A
 IPC would show that 

              cruelty would mean any wilful conduct which was of such 

              a   nature   as   was   likely   to   drive   a   woman   to   commit 

              suicide   or   to   cause   grave   injury   or   danger   to   life, 

              limb   or   health   whether   mental   or   physical)   to   the 

              woman.   We find   no evidence on this score and it has 

              been so found by the High Court.   On the contrary, a 

              perusal   of   the   evidence   of   P.W.   6     shows   that   the 

              defence   story   is   in   fact   reflected   in   his   cross-

              examination.  He initially testified that it was wrong 

              to suggest that she did not want to stay in the village 


Crl.A. No. 808 of 2005                                                                                                          REPORTABLE


                                                                                                   6






              or that she wanted to join service but in the very next 

              line he admitted that the reason that the deceased was 

              not   encouraged   to   shift   to   Moga   was   that   as   the 

              appellants were old they had wanted her to work in the 

              house   and   to   look   after   them.       In   this   view   of   the 

              matter,   we   find   that   the   wilful   conduct   referred   to 

              above   should   be   of   such   a   nature   as   would   provoke   a 

              person   of   common   prudence   to   commit   suicide   and   a 

              difference   of   opinion   within   a   family   on   everyday 

              mundane   matters   would   not   fall   within   that   category. 

              We find that merely because the appellants were of the 

              opinion  that  the  deceased,  as  a  good  daughter-in-law, 

              should look after them in old age could not be said to 

              an abetment of suicide.    The presumption against the 

              appellants   raised   under   
Section   113A
   of   the   Evidence 

              Act, 1872 cannot thus be drawn. We are, therefore, of 

              the opinion that the High Court's judgment suffers from 

              serious   contradictions.     We,   accordingly,   allow   this 

              appeal and set aside the conviction of the appellants 

              before us.  Their bail bonds be discharged.
