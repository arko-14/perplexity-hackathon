1.    Leave granted.



2.       Cruel hands of destiny played havoc with the life of Ravi, then aged 8 years, on 



account   of   motor   road   accident,   on   7.10.2001   at   about   8.30   AM,   when   rear   side   of 



truck   bearing   Registration   No.   RJP   -   1008,   driven   by   Respondent   No.   1   - 



Badrinarayan,   owned   by   Respondent   No.   2   -   Prahlad   Singh     and   insured   with 



Respondent   No.   3   -   M/s.   National   Insurance   Company   Limited,   hit   the   victim, 



causing multiple injuries to him. To add to his miseries, his claim petition filed under 




Section 140
 and 
166
 of the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988 (hereinafter shall be referred to 



as     '
M.V.   Act
')   before   Motor   Accident   Claims   Tribunal,   Jaipur   (for   short,   `MACT'), 



registered as Claim Petition No. 865 of 2004, came to be dismissed on 19.9.2007 by


C.A. @ S.L.P.(C)No.11974/08 .... (contd.)




                                                   - 2 -

                                                  - 2 -



 learned Presiding Judge of the said Tribunal, mainly on the ground that formal FIR of 



the incident was lodged belatedly and Appellant failed to establish that on the fateful 



day, the said truck was involved in a motor road accident causing injuries to him.   



3.       An appeal filed before the learned Single Judge of the High Court of Judicature 



for Rajasthan, Jaipur under 
Section 173
 of the M.V. Act also came to be dismissed on 



29.10.2007.   Thus,   all   hopes   of,   at   least,   getting   some   amount   of   compensation   to 



mitigate the miseries of the victim so as to lead a respectful and decent life had come 



to a grinding halt. It is under these circumstances, he has preferred the present appeal. 



4.       The question which arises for our consideration in this Appeal is as to whether 



delay in lodging the FIR of the accident could prove fatal so as to result into dismissal 



of the Claim Petition filed by the claimant?



5.       Facts shorn of unnecessary details are as under:-



         On 7.10.2001, at about 8.30 AM, Ravi was attending to his call of nature, just in 



front   of  his   house.  There  appears  to  be  a  20'   wide  kutcha  road  in  front   of  the     said 



house.  At  that  time,  Respondent  No. 1, Badrinarayan,  was reversing  truck bearing 



Registration No. RJP - 1008. Since there was no conductor, probably, he was not able 



to notice that Ravi was sitting on the side of the road, thus while reversing the vehicle 



rashly and negligently, it hit him from behind.  The said accident was witnessed by AW 



1 - Suresh Kumar,  father  of  the  victim  and  AW 2,  Hari  Narayan.  Soon  after  the 


C.A. @ S.L.P.(C)No.11974/08 .... (contd.)




                                                    - 3 -

accident, both of them took Ravi to the hospital for treatment. Thus, they were not in 



a position to lodge the FIR immediately. Even though police had come to the hospital 



to   record   FIR   but   it   could   not   be   recorded   on   account   of   mental   agony   and   stress 



through which AW 1 - Suresh Kumar was passing. Obviously at that point of time, he 



was more concerned to get the medical treatment for his son rather than lodging FIR. 



Being a common man, oblivious of the niceties of law, he did not deem it necessary to 



lodge   the   FIR   immediately.   Statements   of   Hari   Narayan,   Suresh   Kumar,   Asif   Khan 



and   Ravi     were   recorded   under   
Section   161
   CrPC.   On   notice   being   issued   under 




Section 133
 of the M.V. Act, the owner of the vehicle submitted the following reply :



                           "It  is submitted  that as per  the registration  I  am owner of 

                  truck no. RJP- 1008.  On 7.10.2001 and at the time of the accident, 

                  my   truck   was   being   driven   by   the   driver   Badri   Narayan   S/o   sh. 



                  Ram   Nath   Cast,   Brahmin,   Age   45   years   R/o   Purana   Ghat, 

                  opposite   Khaniya   Dayal     Hospital,   Police   Station   -   Transport 

                  Nagar, Jaipur. I was informed about the said accident on phone on 

                  the very same day.



                  Sd/- (Prahlad Singh)

                  Dated: 16.3.2002."



6.       This   admission   of   Prahlad   Singh,   owner   of   the   vehicle,   amply   proves   that   he 



was aware of the accident and knew that his truck bearing Registration No. RJP - 1008 



had met with accident on 7.10.01. Even though the aforesaid statement of Respondent 



No.   2,   Prahlad   Singh,   was   recorded   on   16.3.2002,   but   in   this   statement   he   has 



categorically admitted  that he was  informed about  the said accident on phone on the 


C.A. @ S.L.P.(C)No.11974/08 .... (contd.)

very same day, i.e., on 7.10.01. It is also not in dispute that at the relevant point of time 



the   said   truck   was   being   driven   by   Respondent   No.   1,   Badrinarayan,   a   fact   also 



admitted by the owner of the truck.  



7.       Father  of the victim,  Suresh  Kumar, lodged formal FIR under 
Section 154
 of 



the CrPC on 26.1.2002,  almost after  3 months from the date of the accident, giving 



details of the said accident. 



8.       Thereafter, as mentioned hereinabove, the Appellant, being minor, filed a claim 



petition through his father, before MACT claiming Rs. 11 lakhs to be awarded to him 



as compensation. 



9.       On   notices   being   issued,   Respondent   Nos.   1   and   2,   driver   and   owner   of   the 



truck respectively, remained absent, despite due service. Thus, they were proceeded ex-



parte. Written statement was filed only by Respondent No. 3, the Insurance Company. 



But the Respondents did not lead any evidence in rebuttal to the evidence led by the 



Appellant.   Even   the   driver   of   the   truck   did   not   enter   the   Witness   Box   to   deny   the 



factum of the accident.



10.      Under the aforesaid circumstances, we have to examine whether the said truck 



was   involved   in   the   accident   and   if   so,   to   what   extent   victim   Ravi   could   be 



compensated.

11.      For the accident that had taken place on 7.10.2001 at 8.30 AM, formal FIR was 



lodged   by   Appellant's   father   with   Police   Station,   T.P.   Nagar,   Jaipur   on   26.1.2002   at 



12.15   PM.   Critical   perusal   thereof  shows  that  Appellant's  father   had  given  the   exact 



and vivid description of the accident and the injuries sustained by his son Ravi in the 



said accident.   He has further disclosed therein that since 7.10.2001, his son Ravi was 



time and again admitted in the Hospital and was undergoing treatment, he could not 



lodge the FIR immediately.  



12.      He further mentioned that police had come to the Hospital next day to record 



the   FIR   and   complete   other   formalities,   but   everyone   present   there suggested 



that since Respondent no.1 was the neighbour of the Appellant, it was not desirable to 



lodge   an   FIR   and   instead   the   matter   of   compensation   could   be   sorted   out   in   an 



amicable   manner   amongst   themselves.     In   view   of   this,   FIR   was   not   lodged 



immediately or soon after the accident.  Secondly, Ravi was still in Hospital undergoing 



treatment,   attending   to   which   was   more   important   for   him   than   lodging   the   FIR. 



Hence, there was delay in lodging the FIR.



13.      It has already been mentioned hereinabove that in response to the notice issued 



under 
Section 133
 of M.V. Act, Respondent No.2, the owner of the vehicle, Prahlad 



Singh categorically admitted that his vehicle had met with an accident on 7.10.2001 and 



he was intimated about the same on phone the very same day. Thus, on this admission, 


C.A. @ S.L.P.(C)No.11974/08 .... (contd.)




                                                       - 6 -

                                                       - 6 -



it is clearly made out that the vehicle in question was involved in the accident, causing 



physical injuries to Ravi.  



14.      On 7.10.2001, Ravi was admitted in the hospital, his injury report form was also 



filled up by the attending doctors, which bears the signature of Ravi's father Suresh. It 



is   clearly   mentioned   therein   that   the   cause   of   injury   was   road   transport   accident   at 



about   9.00   a.m.   on   7.10.2001,   near   his   house.   Suresh,   father   of   the   victim,   further 



declared that at that time he did not want any medical examination relating to police 



case regarding the injuries caused to his son.



15.      When   the   formal   FIR   was   registered   by   Suresh   on   26.1.2002,   a   charge-sheet 



dated 21.03.2002 against Badrinarayan was prepared for commission of offences under 




Section 279
 and 
338
 of the IPC and it was requested that legal action against accused 



Badrinarayan   be   taken.   This   report   was   prepared   by   SHO   of   the   concerned   Police 



Station.   



16.      Under   the   aforesaid   facts   and   circumstances,   it   is   amply   proved   that   the 



aforesaid truck was involved in the road accident, which had caused injuries to Ravi. 



No   doubt,   it   is   true   that   there   has   been   delay   in   lodging   the   FIR   but   the   same   has 



already   been   explained   by   Suresh.   The   explanation   offered   by   him   is   not   only 



satisfactory;  it  inspires  confidence as  cogent  and  valid  reasons  have  been assigned 


C.A. @ S.L.P.(C)No.11974/08 .... (contd.)

                                                        - 7 -



therein.   Not   only   this,   a   consistent   stand   has   been   taken   by   Suresh   right   from   the 



beginning till the lodging of the F.I.R.



17.         The reasons for delay  are as under :-



             i)   Ravi was seriously injured, thus it was more important for Suresh to get him 



                  treated first.



             ii)     Police   had   arrived   at   the   hospital,   where   injury   report   was   prepared   in 



                 which   it   was   mentioned   that   injuries   were   caused   on   account   of   road 



                 accident at 9.00 a.m. on 7.10.2001.



             iii)  The categorical admission made by Prahlad Singh, owner of the truck, that 



                  vehicle   in   question   was   involved   in   the   accident   on   7.10.2001,   when   the 



                  same was being driven by Badrinarayan and this information was conveyed 



                  to him on phone the very same day.  



            iv)       FIR   could   not   be   lodged   immediately   as   other   persons   in   the   locality 



                  pressurised Suresh that it could be sorted out amicably since Badrinarayan, 



                  the driver of the vehicle, was his neighbour.



                  v)     Suresh was not aware of the niceties of law that lodging of FIR was 



                  condition precedent before filing the Claim Petition.



                        All these facts find place in the formal FIR which was registered on 



       26.01.2002 at the instance of Suresh.

18.      The   cumulative   effect   of   the   aforesaid   events   clearly   established   that   accident 



had   taken   place   on   7.10.2001   at   about   8.30   in   the   morning   on   account   of   rash   and 



negligent reversing of the truck by driver Badrinarayan, owned by Respondent No. 2, 



Prahlad Singh. Under these circumstances, it cannot be said that delay in lodging the 



FIR could have proved fatal to the claim case filed by Ravi.



19.      Narration   of   the   aforesaid   events   would   show   the  bona   fides  of   Suresh.   As 



mentioned hereinabove, a consistent stand has been taken right from the beginning till 



the   lodging   of   the   FIR.   The   chronological   events   narrated   hereinabove   inspire 



confidence and it does not smack of a concocted case which has been filed against the 



driver and the owner of the vehicle only with an intention to get compensation.  



20.      It   is   well-settled   that   delay   in   lodging   FIR   cannot   be   a   ground   to   doubt   the 



claimant's   case.   Knowing   the   Indian   conditions   as   they   are,   we   cannot   expect   a 



common man to first rush to the Police Station immediately after an accident. Human 



nature and family responsibilities occupy the mind of kith and kin to such an extent 



that   they   give   more   importance   to   get   the   victim   treated   rather   than   to   rush   to   the 



Police   Station.   Under   such   circumstances,   they   are  not   expected   to   act  mechanically 



with promptitude in lodging the FIR with the Police.   Delay in lodging the FIR thus, 



cannot be the ground  to deny justice to the victim.  In cases  of delay, the  courts are 



required  to  examine  the  evidence with a closer scrutiny and in doing so; the contents

of   the   FIR   should   also   be  scrutinized   more   carefully.   If   court   finds   that   there   is  no 



indication of fabrication or   it has   not been   concocted    or engineered to implicate 



innocent   persons   then,   even   if   there   is   a   delay   in   lodging   the   FIR,   the   claim   case 



cannot be dismissed merely on that ground.



21. The purpose of lodging the FIR in such type of cases is primarily to intimate the 



police   to   initiate   investigation   of   criminal   offences.   Lodging   of   FIR   certainly   proves 



factum of accident so that the victim is able to lodge a case for compensation but delay 



in doing so cannot be the main ground for rejecting the claim petition. In other words, 



although   lodging   of   FIR   is   vital   in   deciding   motor   accident   claim   cases,   delay   in 



lodging the same should not be treated as fatal for such proceedings, if claimant has 



been able to demonstrate satisfactory and cogent reasons for it. There could be variety 



of reasons in genuine cases for delayed lodgment of FIR. Unless kith and kin of the 



victim   are   able   to   regain   a   certain   level   of   tranquility   of   mind   and   are   composed   to 



lodge   it,   even   if,   there   is   delay,   the   same   deserves   to   be   condoned.   In   such 



circumstances, the authenticity of the FIR assumes much more significance than delay 



in lodging thereof supported by cogent reasons.



22.      In the case in hand, the Claims Tribunal as well as the High Court,  committed 



grave   error   in   not   appeciating   the   mental   agony   through   which   Suresh   was   passing, 



whose son was severely injured.

23.      In the light of the aforesaid discussion, we are of the considered opinion  that 



the MACT as well  as High Court  committed error in coming to the conclusion that 



lodging the FIR belatedly would result in dismissal of the claim petition.



24.      Now,   the   question   comes   for   consideration   as   to   how   much   amount   can   be 



awarded to the Appellant. Record shows that victim is now aged about 16 years but is 



still prosecuting his studies in class V only. Apparently, on account of nature of injuries 



sustained  by him, he was  unable  to  prosecute  his studies  in  right earnest  and lagged 



behind   in   the   same.     Medical   Board   Certificate   issued   by   Government   R.D.B.P. 



Jaipuria   Hospital,   Jaipur   dated   17.12.2004   shows   that   he   has   suffered   the   following 



injuries and was admitted as many as on four occasions in the hospital, intermittently :



                              "Diagnosis:   Abdominal   Injury   with   fractured   Pelvis 

            stricture         urethra with ruptured urethra couplet transacted urethra 

            (Case No. 020762)   IInd Adm. 10.11.2001 to 12.11.2001, IIIrd Adm. 



            27.11.01 to 12.12.01; IVth Adm. 28.12.01 to 1.1.2002."



25.      It is to be noted that in a case where injury sustained by victim is of permanent 



nature, he suffers much more than the person who succumbs to the injury.   In  such 



cases, the  injured  has  to  carry  on  the  burden  of permanent disability throughout 



his  life,  which  is  certainly  much  more  painful  to  the  victim.  In  the  present  case,  the 



Appellant had  suffered  an  injury  of  permanent  nature as a result of which he is not

able   to   control   his   urine.   He   has   to   suffer   with   it   throughout   his   life;   thus   the 



compensation should not only be adequate but proper also.



26.      On   account   of   aforesaid   injury,   his   permanent   physical   disability   has   been 



assessed at 50%. This report of the experts further shows that he is unable to control 



urine   and   suffers   from   continence   disability   which   could   not   be   cured   even   after 



surgical operation and frequent dilatation still takes place.



27.      He has also been accordingly issued a permanent disability certificate by the said 



Medical   Board.   Therefore,   the   said   certificate   clearly   establishes   that   Appellant   had 



sustained permanent disability to his own body to the extent  of 50%  and even after 



several surgeries; he was not able to control his urination. We can well appreciate and 



imagine the problems and difficulties of a young boy aged 16 years, who is not able to 



control his urination and spoils his clothes even while attending school. We have been 



given to understand that he is required to go with additional sets of clothings so that 



he could change the same, in case they are spoiled. This is the state of affairs even as 



on date. We do not doubt the genuineness and correctness of the aforesaid certificate. 



Even otherwise, Respondents have also not contended that this certificate is forged or 



fabricated and has been obtained with an intention to get compensation.

28.      Thus, looking into the matter from all angles, it is clearly established that in the 



said accident, Appellant had suffered severe injuries of permanent nature which have 



not   been   cured   till   date   despite   several   surgeries.   In   our   most   modest   computation, 



looking   into   the   nature   of   injuries   which   are   permanent   in   nature,   we   are   of   the 



opinion   that   a   total   amount   of   Rs.   2,50,000   (Rs.   2.5   Lakhs)   to   be   awarded   to   the 



Appellant   payable   by   Respondents   jointly   and   severally,     would   meet   the   ends   of 



justice.   The   aforesaid   amount   would   also   carry   interest   @   6%   p.a.   from   the   date   of 



filing of petition till the same is actually paid. As a result thereof, award of the Claims 



Tribunal and judgment and order of the High Court; are hereby set aside and quashed, 



instead   the   Appellant's   claim   petition   is   allowed   as   mentioned   above   with   costs 



throughout.   The   appeal   is   allowed   accordingly.   Counsel's   fee   quantified   at   Rs. 



10,000/-.
