Bench: 
Harjit Singh Bedi
, 
Chandramauli Kr. Prasad


                            IN THE SUPREME COURT OF INDIA
                   CRIMINAL APPELLATE JURISDICTION

                   CRIMINAL APPEAL NO. 684 OF 2007

 BACHU SINGH                                      ...... APPELLANT

                                  VERSUS

 C.B.I.                                           ...... RESPONDENT



                                O R D E R



1.      We   have   heard   the   learned   counsel   for   the 

parties.



2.      In the light of the facts that have been brought 

out   before   us   by   Ms.   Binu   Tamta,   learned   counsel   for 

the   appellant,   particularly,   that   cognizance   under 


Section 419
 of the Indian Penal Code had been taken on 

the 12th April, 2004, after the matter had been remanded 

by   the   High   Court   which   also   made   the   matter   outside 

limitation,     we   feel   it   appropriate   that   the   matter 

should be remanded to the High Court.   The High Court 

is   requested   to   render   its   opinion   after   making   a 

complete assessment of the facts and on the merits of 

the   controversy.    The  order   impugned  is,   accordingly, 

set aside.



3.      The appeal is allowed to the above extent.
