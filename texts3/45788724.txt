                     :VERSUS:

                           O R D E R



       Leave granted.



       We   have   heard   the   learned   counsel   for   the 

parties. 



       Learned   counsel   for   the   State   of   Uttarakhand 

submits   that   the   State   does   not   want   custodial 

interrogation   of   the   appellants   if   the   appellants 

are directed to appear before the Trial Court on 17th 

March, 2011 (the date fixed for hearing of the case 

by   the   Trial   Court).   We   direct   the   appellants   to 

appear before the Trial Court on 17th March, 2011 and 

on all other subsequent dates as and when they are 



                              2



required by it. In case the appellants do not abide 

by the aforesaid directions of this Court, then the 

interim relief granted to them by this Court can be 

modified by the Trial Court.  





       In   the   facts   and   circumstances   of   this   case, 

we  deem   it  appropriate   to  direct   the  appellants   to 

deposit  their   passports  with   the  Trial   Court  on   or 

before the next date of hearing and the Trial Court 

would   also   be   at   liberty   to   impose   any   other 

conditions   which   it   deems   fit   and   proper   in   the 

facts and circumstances of the case.  





       In   the   event   of   arrest,   the   appellants   are 

directed to be released on bail on their furnishing 

personal   bond   in   the   sum   of   Rs.50,000/-   (Rupees 

Fifty  thousand)   with  two   sureties  each   in  the   like 

amount to the satisfaction of the Trial Court.  






       We   request   the   Trial   Court   to   conduct   the 

trial  of   the  case   on  day-to-day   basis  and   conclude 



                          3



the same as expeditiously as possible. 





      These   appeals   are   disposed   of   with   the 

aforementioned observations and directions.
