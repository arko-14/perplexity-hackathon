           Crl.A. 285 of 2008

                                              1





                              IN THE SUPREME COURT OF INDIA
                              CRIMINAL APPELLATE JURISDICTION

                              CRIMINAL APPEAL NO. 285 OF 2008





            RAM BILAS SINGH                           .....       APPELLANT
                                  

                                           VERSUS

            STATE OF U.P.                             .....       RESPONDENT



                                           WITH 
                              CRIMINAL APPEAL NO. 286 OF 2008



                                         O R D E R



         1.           We have heard the learned counsel for the parties.


         2.           There were seven accused initially in the matter. 

         A4 died during the course of the trial and six acused, 

         accordingly,   were   brought   to   trial.     During   the 

         recording   of   the   evidence,   five   of   the   eye   witnesses 

         Shiv   Ratan   Singh   (PW   1),   Mahadeo   Singh   (PW   2),   Kehar 

         Singh (PW 3), Savitri Devi (PW 4) and Surya Bhan Singh 

         (PW 9) were declared hostile.   The trial court and the 

         High Court, therefore  relied on the evidence of Savitri 

         Devi,   wife   of   the   deceased   alone   and   having   observed 

         that   her   statement   was   corroborated   by   the   medical 

         evidence convicted the accused under 
Section 302
/
149
 IPC 

         and sentenced them to life imprisonment.


Crl.A. 285 of 2008


                                                    2


         3.           During   the   course   of   hearing   today,   Mr.   Ashok 

         Kumar   Singh,   learned   counsel   for   the   appellant   in 

         Criminal Appeal No 286 of 2008 has submitted that in the 

         light   of   the   fact   that   five   eye   witnesses   had   not 

         supported the prosecution and had been declared hostile 

         the implicit reliance on the evidence of P.W. 4, Savitri 

         Devi, was not called for as her presence at the spot too 

         was not believable.   He has pointed out that this fact 

         was   clear   as   the   First   Information   Report   had   been 

         lodged after an inordinate delay.  



         4.           We   have   considered   the   arguments   of   the   learned 

         counsel.  



         5.           We   find   that   this   matter   has   been   dealt   with   by 

         the trial court as well as the High Court.  It has been 

         found as a matter of fact that the statement of P.W. 4 

         was   completely   inspiring   and   there   was   no   reason 

         whatsoever to discard it.   It has also been found that 

         the medical evidence fully supported the involvement of 

         all   the   accused   as   the   nature   and   number   of   injuries 

         suggested   that   they   had   been   caused   with   fire   arms, 

         cutting weapons such as farsas and also by  lathis.  We 

         see   from   the   post   mortem   report   that   17   injuries   have 

         been   caused   to   the   deceased   by   different   kinds   of 

         weapons.   It is true that prima facie there appears to 

         be some  delay in  the lodging  of the  FIR.    On a  closer

         look,   however,   this   is   not   the   case.     The   incident 

         happened at about 6:00p.m. in a rural area about 10 kms 

         away from the police station.  To suggest therefore that 

         Savitri   Devi     who   had   lost   her   husband   would   run   post 

         haste   to   the   police   station   immediately   leaving   her 

         husband alone and fatally injured could not be expected 

         of her.   We are, therefore, of the opinion  that there 

         is no delay in the lodging of the FIR.    There can also 

         be   no   doubt   with   regard   to   the   identity   of   the 

         appellants.     It   has   come   in   evidence   that   the 

         complainant   and   the   accused   party   were   very   well   known 

         to   each   other   and   in   fact   the   motive   of   the   crime   was 

         they   were   involved   in   some   previous   litigations   both 

         civil and criminal.  In this view of the matter, we find 

         no merit in these appeals.  



         6.           Dismissed.
