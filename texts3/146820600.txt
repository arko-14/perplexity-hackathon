(Arising out of Special Leave Petition(C) No.36770/2009)




Sunil Sharma & Ors.                                   ...Appellant(s)

                       VERSUS

Bachitar Singh & Ors.                                  ...Respondent(s)



                               J U D G M E N T



GANGULY, J.





1.    Leave granted.





2.    On 2.08.2006, around 4.40 PM, one Mrs. Sunita Sharma (aged 41 

      years)   was   returning   to   Panchkula   from   Chandigarh   on   her 

      scooter,   when   the   offending   vehicle   (a   Tata   407   bearing 

      registration no. HR-58-5649) driven by the second respondent 

      hit her and ran over her. She was declared dead when taken to 

      hospital.





3.    Legal   heirs   of   the   deceased,   her   husband   and   two   children, 

      filed   a   claim   petition   before   the   Motor   Accident   Claims 

      Tribunal   (MACT)   claiming   Rs.40,00,000/-   as   compensation, 

      along with interest @ 24% p.a. 





4.    MACT   awarded   total   compensation   of   Rs.7,92,000/-.   It 


      calculated   the   same   by   arriving   at   gross   salary   of 

      Rs.14,541/- (based on salary certificate provided by Haryana 

      Women   Development   Corporation   Ltd.),   the   employer   of   Mrs. 

      Sunita   Sharma.   From   the   same,   Rs.1310/-   was   deducted   on 

      various   accounts-   she   was   an   income   tax   assessee,   was   paid 

      HRA amounting to Rs.885/-, CCA Rs.200/- and medical allowance 

      Rs.250/-.  MACT  concluded  that  these  sums  could  not  be  taken 

      into account in the total salary of Sunita. Thus, her total 

      carry   home   salary   was   taken   to   be   Rs.10,000/-   (annual 

      equivalent being Rs.1,20,000/-). A deduction of 40% was made 

      for   personal   expenses,   as   she   was   a   working   woman   and   was 

      also   maintaining   a   scooter.   Thus,   dependency   was   calculated 

      at   Rs.72,000/-,   to   which   a   multiplier   of   11   was   applied. 

      Hence,   compensation   was   calculated   at   Rs.7,92,000/-   along 

      with interest at the rate of 6% p.a.





5.    Aggrieved by the award of MACT, the claimants filed an appeal 

      before  the  High  Court  of  Punjab  and  Haryana  for  enhancement 

      of compensation. The High Court applied the multiplier of 14, 

      instead   of   11   applied   by   MACT.   The   High   Court   took   annual 

      dependency   same   as   that   calculated   by   MACT,   i.e.   Rs.72,000. 

      Accordingly, High Court awarded Rs.2,16,000/- over and above 

      what was awarded by MACT. 





6.    Still   aggrieved,   the   claimants   filed   the   present   appeal 

      before   this   Court.   The   claimants,   appellants   in   the   present 


      appeal, contended that:





      a. MACT should not have deducted HRA, CCA, EPF Group Insurance 

        Scheme and computer advance from the income of the deceased 

        and   these   deductions   should   not   have   been   upheld   by   the 

        High Court.




      b. Deduction of 40% for personal expenses, which was upheld by 

        the High Court, was not correct.




      c. MACT and the High Court did not take into consideration the 

        revision in pay scale of the deceased that came into force 

        from January 2006 (before her death) while calculating her 

        income.




      d. High Court did not grant any compensation for loss of love 

        and   affection,   consortium   and   expenses   towards   funeral 

        rites of the deceased.





7.    We have heard the parties and perused the evidence on record, 

      along with the judgments of the Tribunal and High Court. We 

      now proceed to deal with each point separately.




      a. Computation of Income
                                 





8.    
In   the   case   of  
National   Insurance   Co.   Ltd.  v.  Indira 

      Srivastava   &   Ors.
  [AIR   2008   SC   845],   S.B.   Sinha   J,   has 

      observed   that   "The   term   'income'   has   different   connotations 

      for different purposes. A court of law, having regard to the 

      change in societal conditions must consider the question not 

      only having regard to pay packet the employee carries home at 


the   end   of   the   month   but   also   other   perks   which   are 

beneficial  to  the  members  of  the  entire  family.  Loss  caused 

to the family on a death of a near and dear one can hardly be 

compensated on monitory terms." His Lordship also stated that 

if   some   facilities   were   being   provided   whereby   the   entire 

family stood to benefit, the same must be held to be relevant 

for the purpose of computation of total income on the basis 

of which the amount of compensation payable for the death of 

the   kith   and   kin   of   the   applicants   was   required   to   be 

determined.   This   Court   held   that   superannuation   benefits, 

contributions   towards   gratuity,   insurance   of   medical   policy 

for self and family and education scholarship were beneficial 

to   the   members   of   the   family.   This   Court   clarified   that   by 

opining   that   'just   compensation'   must   be   determined   having 

regard to the facts and circumstances of each case. The basis 

for considering the entire pay packet is what the dependents 

have   lost   in   view   of   death   of   the   deceased.   It   is   in   the 

nature   of   compensation   for   future   loss   towards   the   family 

income" and that "the amounts, therefore, which were required 

to be paid to the deceased by his employer by way of perks, 

should  be  included  for  computation  of  his  monthly  income  as 

that   would   have   been   added   to   his   monthly   income   by   way   of 

contribution to the family as contradistinguished to the ones 

which   were   for   his   benefit.   We   may,   however,   hasten   to   add 

that from the said amount of income, the statutory amount of 

tax payable thereupon must be deducted."






9.     
In  
Raghuvir   Singh   Matolya   &   Ors.   v.  Hari   Singh   Malviya   & 

       Ors.
,   [(2009)   15   SCC   363],   this   Court   has   observed   that 

       dearness   allowance   and   house   rent   allowance   should   be 

       included for computation of income of the deceased.


10.    In   the   present   case,   Haryana   Women   Development   Corporation 

       Ltd. certified that the deceased had drawn her salary for the 

       month of July, 2006 as under:



       Basic Pay                  -Rs.7,100/-

       D.P                          -Rs.3,550/-

       D.A.                         -Rs.2,556/-

       HRA                          -Rs.885/-

       CCA                          -Rs.200/-

       Med. Allowance      -Rs.250/-

       Gross Total
                         
                                
                                   -Rs.14,541
                                                       

       Deduction

       EPF                          -Rs.780/-

       GIS                          -Rs.30/-

       Computer Advance             -Rs.500/-

       Total Deduction
                                
                                   -Rs.1.310/-
                                                  


       Net Payable= Rs.14,541 - Rs.1,310 = Rs.13,231/-




11.    Based   on   the   aforementioned   judgments,   we   are   of   the   view 

       that deductions made by the Tribunal on account of HRA, CCA 

       and   medical   allowance   are   done   on   an   incorrect   basis   and 

       should   have   been   taken   into   consideration   in   calculation   of 

       the   income   of   the   deceased.   Further,   deduction   towards   EPF 

       and   GIS   should   also   not   have   been   made   in   calculating   the 

       income of the deceased. 





12.    Thus, we calculate the income of the deceased by taking the 

       abovementioned   allowances   into   consideration.   However,   the 

       computer   advance   should   not   form   a   part   of   the   monthly 

       income.   The   monthly   income   of   the   deceased   thus   amounts   to 

       Rs.15,351/-.   Thus,   the   annual   income   of   the   deceased   would 

       amount to Rs. 1,84,212/-.





       b.    Deduction for Personal Expenses





13.    The Tribunal deducted 40% from the income of the deceased by 

       way of personal expenses and the same was upheld by the High 

       Court. We are of the view that both courts erred in doing the 

       same   in   light   of   the   judgment   in   the   case   of  
Sarla   Verma 

       (Smt.)   and   others  v.  Delhi   Transport   Corporation   &   Anr.
, 

       [(2009) 6 SCC 121], wherein this Court held:


             "we   are   of   the   view   that   where   the   deceased   was 
             married, the deduction towards personal and living 
             expenses   of   the   deceased,   should   be   one-third 
             (1/3rd) where the number of dependent family members 
             is   2   to   3,   one-fourth   (1/4th)   where   the   number   of 
             dependent  family members  is 4  to 6,  and one-fifth 
             (1/5th) where the number of dependent family members 
             exceed six."





14.    Hence, we hold that as the deceased was married, a deduction 

       of   1/3rd  should   be   made   to   her   income   by   way   of   personal 

       expenses.   After   such   deduction,   the   income   of   the   deceased 

       would   thus   amount   to   Rs.1,22,808/-,   which   we   round   off   to 

       Rs.1,22,800/-.





       c.    Revision in Pay Scale





15.    
In  
Sarla   Verma
  (supra),   this   Court   laid   down   a   `rule   of 

       thumb'   with   respect   to   addition   in   income   due   to   future 

       prospects.   This   Court   observed   that   the   addition   should   be 

       only 30% if the age of the deceased was 40 to 50 years.


16.    In the present case, the deceased was aged 41 years. Thus, we 

       allow   an   addition   of   30%   by   way   of   future   prospects.   The 

       annual   income   of   the   deceased   would   thus   be   Rs.1,59,640/-. 

       Considering the age of the deceased, a multiplier of 14 is to 

       be   applied.   Accordingly,   annual   dependency   comes   to 

       Rs.22,34,960/-.






       d     Compensation for Loss of Love and Affection, Consortium, 
             Funeral Rites





17.    In cases of fatal motor accidents, some amount must always be 

       awarded by way of compensation for loss of love and affection 

       and consortium. It is of course impossible to compensate for 

       the loss of a life, in the present case, that of a wife and 

       mother, in terms of money. However, we can make an attempt to 

       do so. Accordingly we award Rs.25,000/- for loss of love and 

       affection and consortium.





18.    Thus,  total  compensation  payable  to  the  claimants-appellants 

       is Rs.22,59,960/- which is rounded off to Rs.22,60,000/- with 


       interest at the rate of 6% from the date of filing the claim 

       petition.





19.    Accordingly the appeal of the claimants-appellants is allowed 

       to the extent indicated above. 





20.    The respondents are jointly and severally liable to make the 

       aforesaid payment, after adjusting payment, if any, is made. 

       Such payment is to be made within three months. No costs.
