       Leave granted.



       We   have   heard   the   learned   counsel   for   the 

parties. 



       This   appeal,   by   special   leave,   is   directed 

against the judgment and order dated 4th  April, 2007 

passed   by   the   Division   Bench   of   the   High   Court   of 

Judicature at Allahabad in Special Appeal No.330 of 

2003 which was preferred against the order dated 11th 

March,   2003   passed   by   the   learned   Single   Judge   in 

Civil Misc. Writ Petition No.53906 of 2002.


       We   are   told   that   Writ   Petition   No.2829   of 

2009, which is also filed by the present appellant, 

is pending before the Lucknow Bench of the Allahabad 

High Court. 



                              -2-


       In   the   facts   and   circumstances   of   this   case, 

we deem it appropriate to set aside the judgment and 

order dated 4th  April, 2007 passed by the High Court 

of Judicature at Allahabad in Special Appeal No.330 

of   2003   as   also   the   order   dated   11th  March,   2003 

passed in Civil Misc. Writ Petition No.53906 of 2002 

and   remit   this   matter   to   the   Lucknow   Bench   of   the 

Allahabad   High   Court   to   be   heard   along   with   Writ 

Petition No.2829 of 2009. 



       We   request   the   High   Court   to   dispose   of   the 

writ petitions  as expeditiously as possible, in any 

event, within a period of one year from the date of 

communication of this order.  



       This appeal is disposed of accordingly.
