                   IN THE SUPREME COURT OF INDIA

                   CRIMINAL APPELLATE JURISDICTION

                   CRIMINAL APPEAL NO. 135 OF 2010


Budhadev Karmaskar                                   ..Appellant

                          versus

State of West Bengal                                 ..Respondents


                          O R D E R



       Heard learned counsel for the appellant.

       This   Appeal     has   been   filed   against     the    impugned

judgment and order dated 25th July, 2007 passed by the High

Court of Calcutta in C.R.A. No. 487 of 2004.


       The facts have been set out in the impugned judgment

and hence we are not repeating the same here except wherever

necessary.



       This is a case of brutal murder of a sex worker.

Sex workers are also human beings and no one has a right to

assault or murder them.        A person becomes a prostitute not

because she enjoys it but because of poverty.             Society must

have sympathy towards the sex workers and must not look down

upon them.    They are also entitled to a life of dignity in

view of 
Article 21
 of the Constitution.



       In    the    novels   and   stories    of   the   great   Bengali

Writer Sharat Chand Chattopadhyaya, many prostitutes have
been   shown   to    be   women   of   very    high   character,   e.g.,

Rajyalakshmi in 'Shrikant', Chandramukhi in 'Devdas' etc.


                                   -2-


The plight of prostitutes has been depicted by the great

Urdu poet Sahil Ludhianvi in his poem 'Chakle' which has

been sung in the Hindi film Pyasa "Jineh Naaz Hai Hind Per

wo kahan hain" (simplified version of the verse 'Sana Khwan-

e-taqdees-e-Mashrik Kahan Hain').



        We may also refer to the character Sonya Marmelodov

in Dostoyevsky's famous novel 'Crime and Punishment'.              Sonya

is depicted as a girl who sacrifices her body to earn some

bread for her impoverished family.



        Reference may also be made to Amrapali, who was a

contemporary of Lord Buddha.



        In the present case, the incident happened on 17th

September, 1999 at about 9.15 p.m.            The deceased Chayay Rani

Pal alias Buri was living in a red light area and was a

resident of Room No.8 of Premises No.19, Jogen Dutta Lane in

Calcutta.      She was evidently a sex worker. The appellant

Budhadev kicked her with fists and legs, and she fell down

on the floor.       The appellant then caught her by her hair and

banged her head against the floor and the wall several times

which left the victim bleeding from her ear, nose and head.

The incident was witnessed by four persons, Pw2-Abida, PW4-

Maya, PW7-Asha and PW8-Parvati.



        PW2-Abida has deposed that she saw the appellant-
accused catching the victim by her hair and banging her head

against the wall.        The victim was profusely bleeding through

her nose and mouth.         On seeing this, Abida started shouting

and then the accused pushed her and went down and fled away.

PW8-Parvati saw the victim being mercilessly beaten by the


                                     -3-


accused-appellant, and the same is the evidence of PW7-Asha.

In the post mortem, as many as 11 injuries on the body of

the victim were found, eight of which were on various parts

of the face and forehead.



          The police was informed about the incident over the

telephone as is evident from the testimony of PW2 Abida.

After the police arrived on the spot, sample of the blood

spilled    from    the   body   of   the   victim   was   collected   and

photographs taken.          The victim was brought by Asha Khatoon

and others to the hospital where she was found 'dead on

arrival'.       Blood was oozing out from her ear and nostril.

There was swelling on the left eyeball and left eyebrow.

Thus,     the     medical     evidence     corroborates     the   ocular

testimony.



          PW10-Dr. Amitava Das, the Medical Officer who held

the post mortem examination of the dead body of deceased

Chhaya Rani Pal found the following injuries on her person:




          1) Abrasion 1" x = " over the nose just below
             the nasal bridge.

          2) Abrasion = " x = " over left side forehead =
             " above left eyebrow 3" left to midline.

       3) Abrasion = " x = " over left side of
          forehead just over the left eye brow 2" left
          mid line.

       4) Bruise 2" x 1" over left upper eye lid.

       5) Bruise 2" x 1" over anterior aspect of mid
          part of nose.

       6) Abrasion = " x < " over right side of
          forehead 1" above right eye brow 2" right to
          mid line.

       7) Abrasion 2" x 1" over right side of face
          just below the right eye and just right to
          outer canthus of right eye.

       8) Lacerated wound = " x < " x scalp over left
          partial region 4 = " left to anterior mid
          line and 2" below left parietal eminence.

                           -4-


       9) Abrasion 3" x = " over posteriorateral
          aspect of right forehead 1" below right
          elbow.

       10)Abrasion 1" x = " over anterior medial
          aspect of lower part of right forearm 1"

          above right wrist.

       11)Abrasion 4" x 3" over upper part of
          posterior aspect of right thigh 7" above
          right knee joint.



       On   dissection,   the   Doctor   found   the   following

injuries:



       1) Heamatoma 3 = " x 2" in the scalp tissue
          over right frontal region.

       2) Heamatoma 3 = " x 2" in the scalp tissue
          over left frontal region.

       3) Haematoma 3 = " x = " in the scalp tissue
          over left partial region.

       4) Fissured fracture 3" long more or loss
          longitudinal over left parietal temporal
          bone.

       5) Haematoma 2" x 1" in the scalp tissue over
          right parietal region.

       6) Subdural hemorrhage present involving the
          right parietal and temporal lobe.

       7) Lacerated wound = " (half) x < " x substance
          over right parietal lobe of brain substance.

          The abrasions were non-scabbed and red in
          colour.    The bruises were dark red in
          colour. The margins of the lacerated wounds
          were irregular and red in colour.    All the
          injuries showed signs of vital reactions. No
               other injury except those described could be
               detected even on careful dissection and
               examination.



          PW10    Dr.    Amitava    Das,       Medical    Officer    of    Mauza

Burdwan Medical College, opined that the death was due to

the effect of the injuries as noted anti-mortem in nature;

that     all     the    injuries    as    noted     in    the     post    mortem

examination       report    might   be     caused    if    a    person    pushed

against the wall and it may be homicidal in nature."


          The injuries above-mentioned show the brutality of


                                         -5-


the crime. The head of the deceased was battered again and

again in a hideous and barbaric manner.



          The trial Court has rightly convicted the appellant

under 
Section 302
 IPC and sentenced him to life imprisonment

and the High Court has not committed any error in upholding

the conviction and sentence imposed by the trial Court.


          We find no reason to disbelieve the testimony of the

eye witnesses in this case, namely, PW2, PW7 and PW8 which

corroborates the medical evidence. The appellant-accused has

committed murder in a brutal manner of               a helpless women and

deserves no sympathy from this Court.



          For     the    reasons    given       above,     this     appeal    is

dismissed.



          Although we have dismissed this Appeal, we strongly

feel that the Central and the State Governments through

Social     Welfare         Boards    should       prepare       schemes      for
rehabilitation    all    over     the   country    for    physically      and

sexually abused women commonly known as prostitutes                    as we

are of the view that the prostitutes also have a right to

live with dignity under 
Article 21
 of the Constitution of

India since they are also human beings and their problems

also need to be addressed.



         As already observed by us, a woman is compelled to

indulge in prostitution not for pleasure but because of

abject poverty. If such a woman is granted opportunity to

avail    some technical or vocational training, she would be

able to earn her livelihood by such vocational training and




                                    -6-




skill   instead of by selling her body.



         Hence,   we     direct     the    Central       and     the     State

Governments       to       prepare         schemes         for         giving

technical/vocational training to sex workers and sexually

abused women in all cities in India.                The schemes should

mention in detail who will give the technical/vocational

training and in what manner they can be rehabilitated and

settled by offering them employment. For instance, if a

technical training is for some craft like sewing garments,

etc.    then   some    arrangements       should   also    be     made    for

providing a market for such garments, otherwise they will

remain unsold and unused, and consequently the women will
not be able to feed herself.



        We propose to have the response of the Centre and

the States in this regard and hence the case              shall be

listed before us again on 04.05.2011 to be taken up as

first   case   on   which   date   the   first   compliance   report

indicating therein the first steps taken by the Central and

the State Governments in this regard shall be submitted.


        Issue notice to the Central Government and all the

State Governments which will also file responses by the

date fixed for hearing.
