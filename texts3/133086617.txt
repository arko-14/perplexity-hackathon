                           IN THE SUPREME COURT OF INDIA

                CIVIL  APPELLATE JURISDICTION 



              CIVIL APPEAL NO. 2000   OF 2011
             (Arising out of SLP(C) No.4312/2009)


NARAIN AND ORS.                                Appellant(s)

                     :VERSUS:

UNION OF INDIA AND ANR.                        Respondent(s)

                             WITH

              CIVIL APPEAL NO. 2001   OF 2011
             (Arising out of SLP(C) No.4708/2009)





                          O R D E R



       Leave granted.



       We   have   heard   the   learned   counsel   for   the 

parties. 



       This order will dispose of both these appeals. 

       These   appeals   emanate   from   the   judgments   and 

orders dated 27th August, 2008 passed by the Division 

Bench  of   the  High   Court  of   Judicature  at   Rajasthan 

at Jodhpur in Civil Writ Petition Nos.1326/2008 and 

7919/2007   by   which   the   writ   petitions   have   been 

dismissed   summarily   without   giving   any   reasons 

therefor.





                            -2-


       Having   heard   the   learned   counsel   for   the 

parties   and   after   perusing   the   records,   we   are   of 

the   considered   view   that   the   High   Court   ought   to 

have   given   reasons   for   deciding   the   matters.     We 

are,   therefore,   constrained   to   set   aside   the 

impugned judgments and orders dated 27th August, 2008 

passed   by   the   Division   Bench   of   the   High   Court   of 

Judicature   at   Rajasthan   at   Jodhpur   in   Civil   Writ 

Petition   Nos.1326/2008   and   7919/2007,   and   remit 

these   matters   to   the   High   Court   for   deciding   them 

afresh in accordance with law by passing a reasoned 

order.  



       Since the matters have been pending for quite 

some time, We request the High Court to dispose of 

both   the   writ   petitions     as   expeditiously   as 

possible, in any event, within a period of one year 

from the date of communication of this order.  


       These   appeals   are   disposed   of   with   the 

aforementioned observations.
