Bench: 
Chandramauli Kr. Prasad

                               IN THE SUPREME COURT OF INDIA
                  CRIMINAL APPELLATE JURISDICTION

                   CRIMINAL APPEAL NO. 66 OF 2006




 STATE OF U.P.                                   ...... APPELLANT

                                  VERSUS

 RAJENDRA SINGH & ORS.                           ...... RESPONDENTS





                                O R D E R



1.     We   have   heard   the   learned   counsel   for   the 

parties.



2.     We find that the trial court has given very good 

reasons   while   acquitting   the   accused   and   on   very 

correct appreciation of the evidence.  Keeping in view 

the   fact   that   the     judgment   of   the   trial   court   was 

possible on the evidence, the High Court declined leave 

to appeal.



3.     We,   therefore,   feel   no   interference   is   called 

for in this matter.  Dismissed.
