                    IN THE SUPREME COURT OF INDIA

                   CRIMINAL APPELLATE JURISDICTION

                CRIMINAL APPEAL NO(s). 889 OF 2007


ARUP BHUYAN                                                      Appellant (s)

                                  VERSUS

STATE OF ASSAM                                                   Respondent(s)


                              O    R    D     E    R


       Heard learned counsel for the parties.

       This    Appeal   has    been         filed      against    the     impugned


judgment of the Designated Court, Assam at Guwahati dated

28.03.2007 passed in TADA Sessions Case No. 13 of 1991.


       The facts have already been set out in the impugned

judgment and hence we are not repeating the same here except

wherever necessary.



       The appellant is alleged to be a member of ULFA and the

only    material    produced       by   the       prosecution       against    the

appellant is his alleged confessional statement made before

the Superintendent of Police in which he is said to have

identified the house of the deceased.



       Confession to a police officer is inadmissible vide


Section 25
 of the Evidence Act, but it is admissible in TADA

cases   vide    
Section   15
      of    the       Terrorist      and    Disruptive

Activities (Prevention) Act, 1987.



                                  :1:

      Confession is a very weak kind of evidence.                           As is well

known, the wide spread and rampant practice in the police in

India     is    to    use   third     degree      methods        for        extracting

confessions from the alleged accused.                         Hence, the courts

have to be cautious in accepting confessions made to the

police by the alleged accused.



      Unfortunately,        the     police       in    our      country       are    not

trained in scientific investigation (as is the police in

Western    countries)       nor     are    they       provided        the    technical

equipments for scientific investigation, hence to obtain a

conviction       they    often    rely      on    the     easy     short       cut    of

procuring a confession under torture.





      Torture is such a terrible thing that when a person is

under torture he will confess to almost any crime. Even Joan

of Arc confessed to be a witch under torture.                          Hence, where

the     prosecution      case     mainly     rests       on     the    confessional

statement made to the police by the alleged accused, in the

absence    of    corroborative            material,      the     courts       must    be

hesitant before they accept such extra-judicial confessional

statements.



      In the instant case, the prosecution case mainly relies

on the alleged confessional statement of the appellant made

before     the       Superintendent        of         Police,     which        is    an


                                  :2:

extra-judicial       confession       and    there         is     absence      of

corroborative material. Therefore, we are of the opinion

that it will not be safe to convict the accused on the basis

of alleged confessional statement.



       For the reasons stated above, we are in agreement with

the impugned judgment so far as it has taken the view that

the confessional statement in question cannot be acted upon

as the sole basis for conviction of the appellant.


       However, the TADA Court has convicted the appellant

under 
Section 3(5)
 of the TADA which makes mere membership

of a banned organisation criminal. Although the appellant

has denied that he was a member of ULFA, which is a banned

organisation. Even assuming he was a member of ULFA it has

not been proved that he was an active member and not a mere

passive member.



 
In 
State of Kerala       Vs. Raneef
,         2011 (1) SCALE 8, we

have    respectfully    agreed       with    the    U.S.        Supreme     Court

decision in Elfbrandt       Vs.       Russell,       384 U.
S. 17 (1966)


which has rejected the doctrine of 'guilt by association'.


Mere    membership     of   a     banned      organisation          will      not

incriminate   a   person    unless      he   resorts       to     violence    or

incites people to violence or does an act intended to create

disorder or   disturbance       of    public       peace    by     resort    to


                             :3:

violence (See : also the Constitution Bench judgment of this

Court in 
Kedar Nath        Vs.        State of Bihar
, AIR 1962 SCC 955

para 26).




       In Clarence Brandenburg           Vs.    State of Ohio,        395 U.S.

444 (1969) the U.S. Supreme Court went further and held that

mere     "advocacy    or   teaching           the   duty,       necessity,     or

propriety" of violence as a means of accomplishing political

or     industrial    reform,     or    publishing     or    circulating        or

displaying any book or paper containing such advocacy, or

justifying the commission of violent acts with intent to

exemplify, spread or advocate the propriety of the doctrines

of criminal syndicalism, or to voluntarily assemble with a

group formed "to teach or advocate the doctrines of criminal

syndicalism" is not per se illegal. It will become illegal

only if it incites to imminent lawless action.                     The statute

under challenge was hence held to be unconstitutional being

violative of the First and Fourteenth Amendments to the U.S.

Constitution.



       In United States        Vs.       Eugene Frank Robel, 389 U.S.

258,    the   U.S.   Supreme     Court     held     that    a    member   of    a

communist organisation could not be regarded as doing an

unlawful act by merely obtaining employment in a defence

facility.



       We respectfully agree with the above decisions, and are


                                        :4:

of   the   opinion    that       they   apply       to    India      too,    as     our

fundamental rights are similar to the Bill of Rights in the

U.S. Constitution.



      In our opinion, 
Section 3(5)
 cannot be read literally

otherwise    it   will     violate       
Articles         19
   and    
21
     of    the

Constitution.        It    has    to    be   read    in     the   light      of     our

observations made above.           Hence, mere membership of a banned

organisation will not make a person a criminal unless he

resorts to violence or incites people to violence or creates

public disorder by violence or incitement to violence.


      Hence, the conviction of the appellant under 
Section

3(5)
 of the TADA is also not sustainable.


      The impugned judgment of the Designated Court, Assam at

Guwahati dated 28.03.2007 passed in TADA Sessions Case No.

13 of 1991 is set aside and the Appeal stands allowed.


      By Order dated 29.10.2007 this Court had directed that

the appellant be released on bail on his furnishing adequate

security to the satisfaction of the trial court.                            Security

furnished    by      the     appellant        in         pursuance      of        Order

dated 29.10.2007 shall stand discharged.
