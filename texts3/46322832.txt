Khaja Shariff & Ors vs B.H.E.L., Hyderabad on 17 February, 2011


Bench: 
Mukundakam Sharma
, 
Dalveer Bhandari


                               IN THE SUPREME COURT OF INDIA

                    CIVIL  APPELLATE JURISDICTION 



                   CIVIL APPEAL NO. 44  OF 2007

   KHAJA SHARIFF & ORS.                           Appellant(s)

                         :VERSUS:

   B.H.E.L., HYDERABAD                            Respondent(s)





                               O R D E R



 
The   short   question   which   arises   for   our 

     consideration in this appeal is that in view of the 

     judgment   of   the   Andhra   Pradesh   High   Court   in  
B.F. 

     Pushpaleela Devi vs. State of A.P., Education Dept. 

     and Ors.
, 2002 (5) ALT 103 (L.B.), the writ appeal 

     is maintainable or not.




            Learned   counsel   for   the   appellants   has   drawn 

     our   attention   to   paragraph   53   of   the   aforesaid 

     judgment in which it is mentioned that "if the order 

     has re-determined the valuable rights of the parties 

     to   the   proceeding,   whether   without   issuing   any 

     notice or after issuing notice, it is a judgment as 

     per the tests 
laid down in
 Khimji's case".  





                                  -2-



       In the present case, the learned Single Judge 

by   an   elaborate   judgment   has   dismissed   the   review 

petition.   Therefore,   against   the   said   order,   writ 

appeal was maintainable  and the High Court ought to 

have   given   a   reasoned   order.   In   this   view   of   the 

matter, we set aside the impugned judgment and remit 

the   matter   to   the   High   Court   to   decide   the   writ 

appeal in accordance with law.  



       Since  the   matter  has     been   pending  for   quite 

some  time,   therefore,  we   request  the   High  Court   to 

dispose   of   the   writ   appeal   as   expeditiously   as 

possible. 



       However,   it   is   made   clear   that   we   have   not 

expressed any opinion on the merits of the case.  


       The appeal is disposed of accordingly.
