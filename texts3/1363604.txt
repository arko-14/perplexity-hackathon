A. K. PATNAIK, J.



      These   two   appeals   are   against   two   separate   but 



identical   orders   passed   by   a   Division   Bench   of   the   High 



Court of Delhi on 22.05.2003 in C.W. No.4555 of 2002 and 



C.W. No.4556 of 2002.



                                    2


2.    The   facts   very   briefly   are   that   in   the   Department   of 



Telecommunications   of   the   Government   of   India   there   are 



four Grades of employees and these are:



                                      3


      Basic Grade [Telegraph Assistant / Telegraphist]   =  Pay

       Scale Rs.975-1660.





      Grade   II   [Section   Supervisor   /   Telegraph   Master]   =   Pay 

      Scale Rs.1400-2300.





      Grade   III   [Senior   Section   Supervisor]   =   Pay   Scale 

      Rs.1600-2660.





      Grade IV [Chief Section Supervisor] = Pay Scale Rs.2000-

      3200.





2.      Initially,   promotions   from   one   Grade   to   the   higher 


        grade were made on the basis of seniority to the 2/3rd 



        of   the   posts   and   on   the   basis   of   departmental 



        examination to the 1/3rd of the posts.  With effect from 



        30.11.1983,   the   Government   of   India,   Ministry   of 



        Communications,   Department   of   Telecommunications 



        (for   short   `the   Government')   introduced   One   Time 



        Bound   Promotion   Scheme   under   which   regular 



        employees, who had completed sixteen years of service 



        in   a   grade,   were   placed   in   the   next   higher   grade. 




        Thereafter,   by   a   circular   dated   16.10.1990   the 



        Government   introduced   a   new   Scheme   known   as 



        `Biennial   Cadre   Review'   (for   short   `the   BCR   Scheme'). 



        Under the BCR Scheme, those employees, who were on 



        regular   service   as   on   01.01.1990   and   had   completed 



                                       4





      26   years   of   satisfactory   service   in   the   basic   grades, 



      were   to   be   screened   by   a   duly   constituted   Committee 



      to   assess   their   performance   and   determine   their 



      suitability   for   advancement   and   if   they   were   found 



      suitable they were to be upgraded in the higher scale. 



      The   circular   dated   16.10.1990,   however,   limited   such 



      upgradation to 10% of the posts in the lower pay-scale 



      and   the   review   of   the   cadres   for   the   purpose   of   such 



      upgradation was to take place once in two years.   The 



      Government  then  issued  clarifications  on some points 



      in   its   letter   dated   11.03.1991   on   the   BCR   Scheme. 



      Point   No.10   and   the   clarification   thereon   in   the   letter 



      dated 11.03.1991 are quoted hereunder:- 



"Point raised by the field unit                         Clarification


 "10.          Whether         Officers     The   seniority   of   officials   is 

 already   having   pay   scale   of        to   be   maintained   with 

 Rs.1600-2600   will   rank                 reference   to   the   basic 

 senior   to   Officials   in   the         cadres           and         functional 

 scale   of   Rs.1400-2300   for            promotional   posts   they 

 the   10%   quota   (Rs.2000-              hold   and   not   merely   with 

 3200)                                      reference   to   the               pay 

                                            scales."





4.    Some officers of Grade III who were senior in the basic 



grade   but   had   lost   their   seniority   in   Grade   III   because   of 



                                     5





their   later   promotions   and   who   were   not   considered   for 



upgradation   to   Grade   IV   under   the   BCR   Scheme,   namely, 



Smt. Santosh Kapoor and others, filed O.A. No.1455 of 1991 



before   the   Central   Administrative   Tribunal,   New   Delhi, 



contending on the basis of clarification on Point No.10 made 



in the letter dated 11.0.3.1991 that under the BCR Scheme, 



seniority   in   the   basic   grade   was   to   be   counted   for   the 



purpose of upgradation on completion of 26 years of service 



and   this   contention   was   resisted   by   the   Government   and 



other respondents in the O.A. and the Tribunal in its order 



dated 07.07.1992 directed that promotions of 10% posts in 



the   scale   of   Rs.2000-3200   (Grade   IV)   would   have   to   be 



based on seniority in the basic grade subject to fulfillment of 



other   conditions   in   the   BCR   Scheme   and   further   directed 



the Government to consider the applicants in the O.A. from 



due   dates   with   consequential   benefits.     In   the   order   dated 



07.07.1992, the Tribunal, however, observed that employees 



who may be senior to the applicants in the O.A. in the scale 



of Rs.1600-2660 (Grade III) and who may have already been 



given   the   scale   of   Rs.2000-3200   (Grade   IV)   at   the   cost   of 



those  who were  senior in  the  basic  grades  by   any  different 



                                    6





interpretation of the BCR Scheme, may in the discretion of 



the Government instead of being reverted, be considered for 



promotion   to   scale   of   Rs.2000-3200   (Grade   IV)   by   suitable 



adjustments   in   the   number   of   posts   by   upgradation   as 



necessary.     The   Government   challenged   the   order   dated 



07.07.1992 of the Tribunal in Civil Appeal No.3201 of 1993 



but   by   order   dated   09.09.1993   this   Court   held   that   the 



direction by the Tribunal cannot be faulted and accordingly 



dismissed the appeal. 



5.    Pursuant   to   the   order   dated   07.07.1992   of   the 



Tribunal in O.A. No.1455 of 1991 as affirmed by this Court 



in Civil Appeal No.3201 of 1993, supernumerary posts were 



created   in   the   scale   of   Rs.2000-3200   (Grade   IV)   to   adjust 



the   employees   who   had   already   been   given   the   scale   of 



Rs.2000-3200 on the basis of their seniority in the scale of 



Rs.1600-2660   (Grade   III).     Moreover,   after   a   review   of   the 



procedure   for   promotions   from   Grade   III   to   Grade   IV,   the 



Government   issued   a   fresh   circular   dated   13.12.1995 



saying   that   promotion   to   Grade-IV   may   be   given   from 



amongst officials in Grade-III on the basis of their seniority 



in the basic grade, subject to fitness determined by the DPC 



                                       7





and   subject   to   the   ceiling   of   10%   of   the   posts   in   Grade-III 



(scale Rs.1600-2660) as provided in the BCR Scheme.    



6.     The   respondents   in   C.A.   No.4369   of   2006   Shri 



Ghanshyam   Dass   and   others   filed   O.A.   No.2484   of   1997 



and   the   respondents  in   C.A.   No.4370   of 2006   Shri  Chiddu 



Singh   and   others   filed   O.A.   No.2099   of   1997   before   the 



Central  Administrative  Tribunal  contending   that  employees 



who  were juniors to them  in  the basic grade  but otherwise 



senior   in   Grade-III,   had   been   given   promotion   to   Grade-IV 



earlier   to  the   dates  when   the   respondents   were  given  such 



promotion   and   by   a   common   order   dated   11.08.2000   the 



Tribunal allowed the O.As. and directed the Government to 



consider   promoting   them   to   Grade   IV   with   effect   from   the 



dates   their   immediate   juniors   in   the   basic   grade   seniority 



were so promoted subject to their otherwise being found fit 



for   promotion   on   such   dates   with   consequential   benefits 



including   seniority   and   arrears   of   pay   and   allowances   and 



retiral   benefits   in   the   case   of   those   who   had   retired   on 



superannuation.     The   Government   filed   writ   petitions   C.W. 



No.4555   of   2000   and   C.W.   No.4556   of   2000   in   the   High 



Court of Delhi, but by the two separate impugned orders the 



                                       8





High   Court   found   that   the   Tribunal,   while   allowing   the 



applications, had directed the Government to follow its own 



circular dated 13.12.1995 which had been issued pursuant 



to   the   order   of   the   Tribunal   dated   07.07.1992   in   O.A. 



No.1455 of 1991 which had attained finality after dismissal 



of the appeals by this Court and accordingly dismissed the 



two writ petitions.



7.    When   these   two   Civil   Appeals   were   heard   by   a   two 



Judge Bench of this Court on 14.03.2007, they were of the 



view that the matter should be referred to a larger Bench for 



the reasons stated in the order dated 14.03.2007, which are 



quoted hereinunder:



      "........     The   question   is   that   on   what   basis   the 

      promotion   is   to   be   given.     In   normal   course   of 

      business   a   person   in   Grade-I   is   to   be   promoted 

      on the basis of seniority from Grade I to Grade II 

      and likewise from Grade II to Grade III and from 

      Grade   III   to   Grade   IV.     But   because   of   a 

      clarification   issued   by   the   Department   dated 

      3.4.1991,   the   basic   Grade   seniority   should   be 

      taken   into   consideration   for   promotion   and   not 

      the   pay-scales.     If   this   is   to   be   taken,   then   this 

      will   mean   that   a   person   who   is   in   Grade   I   and 

      has put in 26 years of service on 1.1.1990 will be 

      entitled  for   promotion  from  Grade   I  to  Grade   IV. 

      Therefore,   the   concept   of   basic   cadre   has   to   be 

      interpreted with reference to the seniority in each 

      Grade.     But   on   account   of   the   order   passed   by 

      the   CAT   which   has   been   affirmed   by   this   Court 

      on 9.9.1993 in Civil Appeal No.3201 of 1993 this 



                                        9





      anomalous            situation         has         been         created. 

      Therefore,   in   our   view,   it   is   appropriate   if   this 

      matter   is   referred   to   a   larger   Bench   so   that   the 

      controversy   involved   in   the   matter   can   be 

      resolved. ....."





Thus, the learned Judges were of the view that on account 



of   the   order   passed   by   Central   Administrative   Tribunal   in 



O.A.   No.   1455   of   1991   which   had   been   affirmed   by   this 



Court   on   09.09.1993   in   C.A.   No.   No.3201   of   1993   an 



anomalous   situation   has   been   created   inasmuch   as   a 



person who is in Grade I and had put in 26 years of service 



would   be   entitled   for   promotion   from   Grade   I   to   Grade   IV. 



They were of the view that the concept of basic cadre has to 



be interpreted with reference to the seniority in each grade. 



8.    In   the   course   of   hearing   before   us,   however,   it   has 



been   brought   to   our   notice   by   learned   counsel   for   the 



parties   that   the   controversy   before   us   is   confined   to 



promotions   of   only   employees   from   Grade-III   to   Grade-IV 



and not of employees working in either Grade-I or Grade-II. 



This   will   be   clear   from   the   order   dated   07.07.1992   of   the 



Central   Administrative   Tribunal   in   O.A.   No.1455   of   1991 



[Smt.   Santosh   Kapoor   and   others   v.   Union   of   India   and  



others]  in which the Tribunal  has directed that  promotions 



                                    10





to 10% posts in Grade-IV (Pay Scale 2000-3200) would have 



to   be   based   on   seniority   in   basic   cadres   subject   to 



fulfillment of other conditions in the BCR Scheme and it is 



this order of the Tribunal which was affirmed by this Court 



in   the   order   dated   09.09.1993   in   Civil   Appeal   No.3201   of 



1993.   This will  also be clear from  the fresh circular  dated 



13.12.1995   which   was   confined   to   promotions   from   Grade 



III to Grade IV under the BCR Scheme.  Hence, the question 



of an employee of the basic Grade (Grade-I) being promoted 



to Grade-IV directly does not arise in the appeals before us.



9.    Coming now to the merits of the two appeals before us, 



Mr.   R.D.   Agrawala,   learned   counsel   for   the   appellants, 



submitted that the Central Administrative Tribunal allowed 



the   claims   of   the   respondents   on   the   ground   that   in   the 



basic   grade   they   were   senior   to   some   employees   who   had 



already   been   promoted   to   Grade-IV   and   this   was   clearly 



contrary   to   the   fresh   circular   dated   13.12.1995   of   the 



Government   according   to   which   promotions   to   Grade-IV 



may   be   given   from   amongst   officials   in   Grade-III   on   the 



basis of their seniority in the basic grade. He submitted that 



the Tribunal in its common order in the two O.As. has given 



                                       11





the illustrative example of Lakhpat Rai Gumbar who was at 



serial No.73 of the seniority list in the basic cadre while the 



respondents   Ghanshyam   Dass   and   Shyamlal   Sachdeva, 



who were applicants in O.A. No. 2484 of 1997, were placed 



above   him   in   the   seniority   list   of   the   basic   cadre   at   serial 



Nos.69   and   70   and   yet   Lakhpat   Rai   Gumbar   had   been 



promoted  to Grade-IV by order  dated  08.01.1993 while the 



said   two   Ghanshayam   Dass   and   Shyamlal   Sachdeva   had 



been promoted to Grade-IV with effect from 01.01.1997 and 



01.07.1997   respectively.     Mr.   Agrawala   submitted   that   the 



Tribunal failed to appreciate that Lakhpat Rai Gumbar had 



been   promoted   from   Grade-III   to   Grade-IV   with   effect   from 



08.01.1993   pursuant   to   the   order   dated  07.07.1992   of  the 



Central Administrative Tribunal in O.A. No.1455 of 1991 in 



which   the   Tribunal   had   allowed   the   Government   to   create 



supernumerary   posts   for   promotion   to   Grade-IV   for   those 



employees who were senior to the applicants in the O.A. in 



the   scale   of   Rs.1600-2600   (Grade   III)   and   who   had   been 



given   the   scale   of   Rs.2000-3200   (Grade   IV)   at   the   cost   of 



those   who   were   senior   in   the   basic   grades   by   a   different 



interpretation   of   the   BCR   Scheme.   He   further   submitted 



                                     12





that   the   Tribunal   also   failed   to   appreciate   that   the   fresh 



circular   dated   13.12.1995   of   the   Government   could   have 



only   prospective   effect   and   could   govern   only   promotions 



made   after   13.12.1995   and   in   fact   Ghanshyam   Dass   and 



Shyamlal Sachdeva, the two applicants in O.A. No. 2484 of 



1997,   and  many   other   employees   had  been  promoted   from 



Grade-III  to  Grade-IV  on  the  basis  of  seniority  in  the   basic 



cadre   after   the   fresh   circular   dated   13.12.1995.     He 



submitted   that   the   High   Court   has   lost   sight   of   all   these 



aspects   and   has   affirmed   the   order   of   the   Tribunal   in   the 



two O.As. erroneously. 



10.    Mr.   Sudarshan   Rajan,   learned   counsel   appearing   for 



the   respondents,   in   reply,   submitted   that   the   consolidated 



list of promotions under the BCR Scheme (Annexure P/1 in 



C.A.No.4370   of   2006)   would   show   that   Ghanshyam   Dass 



was   at   serial   No.69   and   Shyamlal   Sachdeva   was   at   serial 



No.70, whereas Lakhpat Rai Gumbar was at serial No.73 in 



the seniority list of the basic grade.  He submitted that since 



the   Central   Administrative   Tribunal   in   its   order   dated 



07.07.1992   in   O.A.   No.1455   of   1991   has   held   that 



promotions   to   10%   posts   in   Grade-IV   would   have   to   be 



                                     13





based   on   seniority   in   the   basic   Cadre,   Ghanshyam   Dass 



and Shyamlal Sachdeva ought to have been promoted before 



Lakhpat   Rai   Gumbar   but   the   chart   at   page   34A   in   C.A. 



No.4370 of 2006 would show that Lakhpat Rai Gumbar was 



promoted   on   08.01.1993   whereas   Ghanshyam   Dass   and 



Shyamlal   Sachdeva   were   promoted   much   later   on 



01.01.1997   and   01.07.1997   respectively.     He   vehemently 



submitted   that   Ghanshyam   Dass   and   Shyamlal   Sachdeva 



and all other respondents have to be given the benefit of the 



order  dated  07.07.1992   of  the   Tribunal   in  O.A.   No.1455  of 



1991 as affirmed by this Court, even though they were not 



parties   in   the   aforesaid   O.A.   before   the   Tribunal   or   before 



this   Court.     He   cited   the   decision   in  
K.I.   Shephard   and  



others  v.  Union   of   India   and   others
  [(1987)   4   SCC   431]   in 



which this Court held that employees who had not come to 



the   Court   should   not   be   penalized   for   not   having   litigated 



and would be entitled to the same benefits as the petitioners 




in that case
.   Mr. Rajan further submitted that the Central 



Administrative   Tribunal   in   its   order   dated   07.07.1992   in 



O.A.   No.1455   of   1991   had   only   observed   that   employees 



who may be senior to the applicants in the O.A. in the scale 



                                    14





Rs.1600-2600 and which may have been given the scale of 



Rs.2000-3200 at the cost of those senior in the basic grades 



may be `considered for promotion' and the Tribunal had not 



given  any  direction  to promote  all such  employees such as 



Lakhpat   Rai   Gumbar.     He   submitted   that   the   clarification 



on   Point   No.6   in   the   letter   dated   11.03.1991   of   the 



Government on the BCR Scheme was that the selection for 



promotion   from   Grade-III   to   Grade-IV   was   to   be   based   on 



merit   and   not   simply   fitness   and,   therefore,   Lakhpat   Rai 



Gumbar   and   others   could   not   have   been   promoted   to 



supernumerary   posts   without   a   proper   selection   on   merit 



pursuant   to   the   order   dated   07.07.1992   of  the   Tribunal   in 



O.A. No.1455 of 1991.




11.    We   have   considered   the   submissions   of   learned 



counsel for the parties.   The order dated 07.07.1992 of the 



Central   Administrative   Tribunal   in   O.A.   No.1455   of   1991 



(Smt.  Santosh  Kapoor   and   Others   v.  Union  of  India  &  Ors.), 



contained the following directions:



        "In the above view of the matter, we direct that 

        the   promotions   to   10%   posts   in   scale   2000-

        3200   would   have   to   be   based   on   seniority   in 

        basic   cadres   subject   to   fulfillment   of   other 

        conditions   in   the   BCR   Scheme   viz.   those   who 

        were regular employees as on 1.1.1990 and had 



                                      15





        completed   26   years   of   service   in   basic   grades 

        (including   higher   scales).     The   respondents   are 

        directed to consider applicants accordingly from 

        due   dates   with   consequential   benefits.     The 

        employees   who   may   be   senior   to   applicants   in 

        the   scale   of   Rs.1600-2660   and   who   may   have 

        already been given the scale of Rs.2000-3200 at 

        the  cost  of  those   senior   in  basic  grades   by   any 

        different interpretation of the BCR Scheme, may 

        in   the   discretion   of   the   respondents,   instead   of 

        being   reverted,   be   considered   for   promotion   to 

        scale   of   Rs.2000-3500   by   suitable   adjustments 

        in   the   matter   of   posts   by   upgradation   as 

        necessary."





It   will   be   clear   from   the   directions   in   the   aforesaid   order 



dated   07.07.1992   in   O.A.   No.1455   of   1991   that   the 



Government was directed to consider only the applicants in 



the   O.A.   for   promotion   to   10%   posts  in   the   scale   Rs.2000-



3200 (Grade-IV) on the basis of seniority in the basic cadres 



from   the   due   dates   with   consequential   benefits.     The 



respondents in the two Civil Appeals before us were not the 



applicants   in   O.A.   No.1455   of   1991   and   there   was   no 



direction to the Government to consider the respondents in 



the   two   appeals   for   promotion   to   Grade-IV   scale   on   the 



basis of seniority in the basic cadre as per the BCR Scheme. 



Hence,   the   respondents   were   not   entitled   to   claim   any 



promotion to Grade-IV on the basis of their seniority in the 



basic   grade   on   the   basis   of   the   order   dated   07.07.1992   of 



                                      16





the   Tribunal   in   O.A.   No.1455   of   1991   as   affirmed   by   the 



order   dated   09.09.1993   of   this   Court   in   Civil   Appeal 



No.3201 of 1993.



12.    
In  
K.I.   Shephard
  (supra)   relied   upon   by   the   learned 


       counsel   for   the   respondents,   this   Court   directed   that 



       each   of   the   transferee   banks   should   take   over   the 



       employees   who   had   been   excluded   from   employment 



       under the amalgamation schemes of the banks on the 



       same   terms   and   conditions   of   employment   under   the 



       respective   banking   companies   prior   to   amalgamation 



       and   further   directed   that   such   employees,   who   were 



       taken   over,   would   be   entitled   to   the   benefit   of 



       continuity   of   service   for   all   purposes   including   salary 



       and perks.   This Court further found that some of the 



       excluded   employees   had   not   come   to   Court   and   held 



       that there was no justification to penalize them for not 



       having   litigated   and   that   they   too   shall   be   entitled   to 



       the   same   benefits   as   the   petitioners   
in   that   case
.




 
There was, therefore, a clear direction in the judgment 



       of this Court in 
K.I. Shephard
 (supra) that the excluded 



       employees,   who   had   not   approached   the   Court,   shall 



                                       17





        also be entitled to the same benefits as the petitioners 



        
in   that   case
   were   entitled   under   the   judgment   of   this 



        Court.     In   the   present   case,   as   we   have   seen,   the 



        Central Administrative Tribunal has not directed in its 



        order   dated   07.07.1992   in   O.A.   No.1455   of   1991   that 



        the   benefits   of   the   order   would   also   be   extended   to 



        those who had not approached the Tribunal.




13.     The principle 
laid down in
 
K.I. Shephard
 (supra) that it 



is not necessary for every person to approach the court for 



relief and it is the duty of the authority to extend the benefit 



of a concluded decision in all similar cases without driving 



every affected person to court to seek relief would apply only 



in the following circumstances:




  a)       where   the   order   is   made   in   a   petition   filed   in   a 

           representative   capacity   on   behalf   of   all   similarly 

           situated employees;





  b)       where the relief granted by the court is a declaratory 

           relief which is intended to apply to all employees in 

           a   particular   category,   irrespective   of   whether   they 

           are parties to the litigation or not; 




  c)       where   an   order   or   rule   of   general   application   to 

           employees   is   quashed   without   any   condition   or 

           reservation   that   the   relief   is   restricted   to   the 

           petitioners before the court; and



                                        18


   d)       where   the   court   expressly   directs   that   the   relief 

            granted   should   be   extended   to   those   who   have   not 

            approached the court. 





14.      On   the   other   hand,   where   only   the   affected   parties 



approach  the   court  and  relief   is  given   to  those  parties,  the 



fence-sitters   who   did   not   approach   the   court   cannot   claim 



that such relief should have been extended to them thereby 



upsetting   or   interfering   with   the   rights   which   had   accrued 



to others. 
In 
Jagdish Lal and others v. State of Haryana and  



others
  [(1997) 6 SCC 538], the appellants who were general 



candidates belatedly challenged the promotion of Scheduled 



Caste   and   Scheduled   Tribe   candidates   on   the   basis   of   the 



decisions   in  
Ajit   Singh   Januja  v.  State   of   Punjab
  [(
1996)   2 



SCC 715],  Union of India  v.  Virpal Singh Chauhan
  [(1995) 6 



SCC   684]   and  R.K.   Sabharwal  v.  State   of   Punjab  [(1995)   2 



SCC 745] and this Court refused to grant the relief saying:




          "....this   Court   has   repeatedly   held,   the   delay 

          disentitles   the   party   to   the   discretionary   relief 

          under   
Article   226
   or   
Article   32
   of   the 

          Constitution.     It   is   not   necessary   to   reiterate   all 

          the catena of precedents in this behalf.  Suffice it 

          to   state   that   the   appellants   kept   sleeping   over 

          their rights for long and elected to wake up when 

          they   had   the   impetus   from  Virpal   Chauhan  and 

          Ajit   Singh  ratios.     But  Virpal   Chauhan  and 

          Sabharwal  cases,   kept   at   rest   the   promotion 

          already made by that date, and declared them as 



                                     19





        valid; they were limited to the question of future 

        promotions   given   by   applying   the   rule   of 

        reservation to all the persons prior to the date of 

        judgment in Sabharwal case which required to be 

        examined   in   the   light   of   the   law   laid   in 

        Sabharwal  case.  Thus earlier promotions cannot 

        be reopened.   
Only those cases arising after that 

        date   would   be   examined   in   the   light   of   the   law 

        laid down in Sabharwal case and 
Virpal Chauhan
  

        case and equally 
Ajit Singh
 case.  If the candidate 

        has already  been further  promoted  to the higher 

        echelons of service, his seniority is not open to be 

        reviewed.
     In  A.B.S.   Karamchari   Sangh   case  a 

        Bench   of   two   Judges   to   which   two   of   us,   K. 

        Ramaswamy   and   G.B.   Pattanaik,   JJ.   were 

        members,   had   reiterated   the   above   view   and   it 

        was   also   held   that   all   the   prior   promotions   are 

        not   open   to   judicial   review.     In  Chander   Pal  v. 


        State   of   Haryana       a   Bench   of   two   Judges 

        consisting of S.C. Agrawal and G.T. Nanavati, JJ. 

        considered   the   effect   of  Virpal   Chauhan,   Ajit  

        Singh,   Sabharwal  and  A.B.S.   Karamchari   Sangh  

        cases  and   held   that   the   seniority   of   those 

        respondents who had already retired or had been 

        promoted to higher posts could not be disturbed. 

        The   seniority   of   the   petitioner   therein   and   the 

        respondents   who   were   holding   the   post   in   the 

        same   level   or   in   the   same   cadre   would   be 

        adjusted   keeping   in   view   the   ratio   in  Virpal  

        Chauhan  and  Ajit   Singh;   but   promotion,   if   any, 

        had   been   given   to   any   of   them   during   the 

        pendency of this writ petition was directed not to 

        be disturbed...." 





Since   the   respondents   preferred   to   sleep   over   their   rights 



and approached the Central Administrative Tribunal only in 



1997,   they   cannot   get   the   benefit   of   the   order   dated 



07.07.1992 of the Tribunal in O.A. No.1455 of 1991 and will 



                                    20





only   be   entitled   to   the   benefit   of   the   circular   dated 



13.12.1995 which was in force in 1997.



15.    We also find on a reading of paragraph 8 of the order 



dated 07.07.1992 of the Central Administrative Tribunal in 



O.A.   No.1455   of  1991   that  the   Tribunal   gave   liberty   to   the 



Government   to   consider   employees   who   were   senior   to   the 



applicants  in   that case   in  a  scale   of Rs.1600-2660  (Grade-



III)   and   who   may   have   already   been   given   the   scale   of 



Rs.2000-3200   (Grade-IV)   at   the   cost   of   those   senior   in   the 



basic   grades   by   any   different   interpretation   of   the   BCR 



Scheme   then   one   given   by   the   Tribunal   by   suitable 



adjustments   in   the   number   of   posts   by   upgradation   as 



necessary.   It appears that pursuant to this liberty granted 



to   the   Government,   Lakhpat   Rai   Gumbar   had   been 



promoted to Grade-IV scale w.e.f. 08.01.1993 because of his 



seniority in Grade-III scale over two the respondents in the 



Civil Appeal No.4369 of 2006, Ghanshyam Dass and others 



and Shyamlal Sachdeva, even though he was junior to these 



officers in the basic grade.  Hence, Lakhpat Rai Gumber was 



promoted   to   one   of   the   posts   in   Grade-IV   created   by   the 



Government   for   the   specific   purpose   of   protecting 



                                     21





promotions   done   on   a   different   interpretation   of   the   BCR 



Scheme   by   the   Government   as   allowed   by   the   Tribunal   in 



the order dated 07.07.1992 in O.A. No.1455 of 1991 and the 



respondents   in   these   appeals   can   have   no   claim   of 



promotion   to   these   supernumerary   posts.     Moreover,   if   the 



respondents were in any way aggrieved by the promotion of 



Lakhpat Rai Gumber and others who were junior to them in 



the basic grade, they could have challenged their promotion 



in the appropriate forum, but they have not done so.



16.    We   further   find   on   a   reading   of   the   circular   dated 



13.12.1995   of   the   Government   that   after   the   order   dated 



07.07.1992   of   the   Tribunal   in   OA.   No.1455   of   1991   was 



affirmed   by   this   Court   in   Civil   Appeal   No.3201   of   1993   on 



09.09.1993   the   Government   undertook   a   review   of   the 



existing procedure of promotion to Grade-IV and decided in 



supersession   of   earlier   instructions   that   promotion   to 



Grade-IV   may   be   given   from   amongst   officials   in   Grade-III 



on   the   basis   of   their   seniority   in   the   basic   grade.     This 



would   be   clear   from   the   relevant   portion   of   the   circular 



dated 13.12.1995 extracted below:



       "Review   of   the   existing   procedure   of   promotion 

       to   Grade-IV   (now   designated   as   Chief   Section 



                                      22





       Supervisor)   under   the   BCR   Scheme   has   been 

       under   consideration   in   view   of   the   judgment   of 

       Principal   Bench,   New   Delhi   upheld   by   the 

       Supreme   Court.     It   has   now   been   decided   in 

       supersession   of   earlier   instructions   that 

       promotion   to   the   said   Grade-IV   may   be   given 

       from amongst officials in Grade-III on the basis 

       of their seniority in the basic grade. ......"





17.    The  language   of  the   circular   dated   13.12.1995   makes 



it crystal clear that the Government took a fresh decision in 



supersession   of   earlier   instructions   that   promotion   to 



Grade-IV   may   be   given   from   amongst   officials   in   Grade-III 



on the basis of their seniority in the basic grade.  Hence, the 



decision of the Government to make promotions to Grade-IV 



on the basis of their seniority in the basic grade could take 



effect  only  from   13.12.1995   and   not  from   a  prior   date  and 



the   respondents,   who   had   filed   O.A.   No.2484   of   1997   and 



O.A. No.2099 of 1997 in the Central Administrative Tribunal 



could not claim any  promotion  to Grade-IV on the  basis  of 



their   seniority   in   the   basic   cadre   with   effect  from   any   date 



prior   to   13.12.1995.     The   Central   Administrative   Tribunal 



was,   therefore,   not   right   in   allowing   O.A.   No.2484   of   1997 



and   O.A.   No.2099   of   1997   by   order   dated   11.08.2000, 



directing   the   Government   to   consider   promoting   the 



                                         23





applicants   to   Grade-IV   with   effect   from   the   dates   their 



immediate   juniors   in   the   basic   grade   seniority   were   so 



promoted subject to their being found fit with consequential 



benefits of seniority as well as arrears of pay and allowance 



and of retiral benefits in the case of those of the applicants 



in   the   O.As.   who   had   retired   on   superannuation.     In   our 



considered opinion, the High Court ought to have interfered 



with the decision of the Tribunal.



18.    We   accordingly   allow   these   appeals   and   set   aside   the 



impugned   orders   dated   22.05.2003   of   the   High   Court   and
