                            IN THE SUPREME COURT OF INDIA

                 CIVIL  APPELLATE JURISDICTION 



             CIVIL  APPEAL NO. 1642   OF  2011

            (Arising out of SLP(C) No.24595/2009)



JASVINDER SINGH SOHAL                      Appellant(s)

                      :VERSUS:

INDIAN BANK AND ANR.                       Respondent(s)





                             O R D E R



        Leave granted.



        We have heard the learned counsel for the parties.

        This   appeal   emanates   from   the   judgment   and   order 

dated 18.12.2008 passed by the High Court of Judicature 

at Bombay in Writ Petition No.5627/2008.


        The appellant was directed to deposit Rs.80 lakhs 

as a condition for getting his appeal heard by the Debts 

Recovery Appellate Tribunal, Bombay. The Appellant could 

not deposit the said amount within the stipulated period, 

hence his appeal stood dismissed.  


        It is not disputed that the entire amount of Rs.80 

lakhs   has   now   been   deposited   by   the   appellant.   In   the 

facts   and   circumstances   of   this   case,   the   delay   in 

depositing the said amount is condoned.





                                -2-


      In the facts of this case, we deem it appropriate 

to direct that the appeal, which was dismissed in default 

for not depositing the amount in time, shall be restored 

to its original number and be heard expeditiously by the 

Tribunal. 



      This          appeal   is   disposed   of   with   these 

observations.
