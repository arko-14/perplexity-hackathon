    S.L.P.(C) Nos.20279-20280/2009:


           Leave granted.



           These   appeals   emanate   from   a   common   judgment 

    dated   7.7.2009   passed   by   the   High   Court   of 

    Judicature   at   Patna   in   L.P.A.   Nos.305/2009   and 

    475/2009.



           We   have   heard   the   learned   counsel   for   the 

    parties.



           Mr.   Ranjit   Kumar,   learned   senior   counsel 



                              2



appearing   for   the   appellants   submits   that   2,149 

candidates have already been selected for the posts 

of Sub Inspectors of Police in the State of Bihar.  


       Mr. Gopal Singh, learned standing counsel for 

the   State   of   Bihar   submits   that   requisition   for 

appointment of 299 posts of Sub Inspectors of Police 

through   direct   recruitment   has   been   sent   to   the 

Staff Selection Commission.    



       In   the   peculiar   facts   and   circumstances   of 

these   cases,   we   direct   the   Bihar   Staff   Selection 

Commission   to   hold   fresh   examinations   for   the   299 

posts   of   Sub   Inspectors   of   Police   and   only   the 

appellants,   who   were   writ   petitioners   before   the 

High Court of Judicature at Patna, whose cases were 

adjudicated   upon   or   are   pending   before   the   High 

Court (total 223 only as per the list given in Court 

by   Mr.   Ranjit   Kumar,   learned   senior   counsel)   would 

be at liberty to appear in the physical and written 

examinations.  



       The schedule of examinations would be decided 

by   the   respondents   and   all   those   who   pass   the 

physical and written examinations would be appointed 

by   the   respondents   and   for   the   remaining   posts   of 

Sub   Inspectors,   a   fresh   advertisement   would   be 



                             3



issued   by   the   Staff   Selection   Commission   and 

appointments would be made in accordance with law. 


       We  hope   and  trust   that  the   entire  process   of 

fresh selection would be completed expeditiously, in 

any   event,   within   six   months   from   the   date   of 

communication of this order. 



       With   these   observations,   these   appeals   are 

disposed  of,   leaving  the   parties  to   bear  their   own 

costs. 



       All the pending I.As. are dismissed.




 S.L.P.(C) Nos.25288-25289/2009 and 4283/2010:


       Leave granted in all the matters.



       These appeals are also disposed of in terms of 


the   aforesaid   order,   leaving   the   parties   to   bear 

their own costs.
