               IN THE SUPREME COURT OF INDIA

               CRIMINAL APPELLATE JURISDICTION

               CRIMINAL APPEAL NO. 1160 OF 2006


Kolla Veera Raghav Rao                           ..Appellant


                       versus

Gorantla Venkateswara Rao & Anr.                 ..Respondents


                       O R D E R



       Heard learned counsel for the parties.

       This   Appeal   has   been   filed   against   the   impugned

judgment and order dated 07th October, 2005 passed by the

High Court of Andhra Pradesh in Criminal Appeal No. 1581 of

1999 and Criminal Revision Case No. 312 of 1999.


       The facts have been set out in the impugned judgment

and hence we are not repeating the same here except wherever

necessary.



       Learned counsel for the appellant submitted that the

appellant was already convicted under 
Section 138
 of the

Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881 and hence he could not be

again tried or punished on the same facts under Section 420

or any other provision of 
IPC
 or any other statute.         We find

force in this submission.



       It may be noticed that there is a difference between

the language used in 
Article 20(2)
 of the Constitution of

India and 
Section 300(1)
 of Cr.P.C..        
Article 20(2)
 states:

      "no person shall be prosecuted and punished for
      the same offence more than once."

CRIMINAL APPEAL NO. 1160 OF 2006

                             -2-



         On the other hand, 
Section 300(1)
 of Cr.P.C. States:


      "300. Person once convicted or acquitted not to
      be tried for same office__

      (1)     A person who has once been tried by a
      Court of competent jurisdiction for an offence
      and convicted or acquitted of such offence shall,
      while such conviction or acquittal remains in
      force, not be liable to be tried again for the
      same offence, nor on the same facts for any other
      offence for which a different charge from the one
      made against him might have been made under sub-

      section (1) of section 221 or for which he might
      have   been   convicted  under   sub-section  (2)
      thereof."




         Thus, it can be seen that 
Section 300(1)
 of Cr.P.C.

is wider than 
Article 20(2)
 of the Constitution.                    While,


Article 20(2)
 of the Constitution only states that 'no one

can be prosecuted and punished for the same offence more

than once', 
Section 300(1)
 of Cr.P.C. states that no one can

be tried and convicted for the same offence or even for a

different offence but on the same facts.


         In    the   present       case,   although   the   offences   are

different but the facts are the same.            Hence, 
Section 300(1)


of   Cr.P.C.    applies.     Consequently,      the   prosecution    under

Section 420, IPC was barred by Section 300(1) of Cr.P.C.


         The Appeal is allowed and the impugned judgment of

the High Court is set aside.
