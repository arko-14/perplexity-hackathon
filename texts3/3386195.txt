             1.                We have heard the learned counsel for the parties.


             2.                On the 22nd  July, 1992 at about 11:00a.m. Satkari 

             Senapati, hereinafter referred to as the  deceased, aged 

             about 76 years was assaulted by his nephew Swapan Kumar 

             Senapati,   the   appellant   herein,   in   the   presence   of, 

             amongst others, P.W. 3 and P.W. 7, the wife and servant 

             of   the   deceased.     As   a   consequence   of   the   attack,   a 

             First   Information   Report   was   registered   at   the   Police 

             Station, on the 25th  July, 1992, under 
Sections 341
 and 

             
325
 of the IPC.  In the First Information Report, it was 

             stated   that   the   relations   between   the   parties   were 

             strained   on   account   of   some   litigation   and   that   the 

             appellant   had   attacked   the   deceased,   had   sat   on   his 

             chest,   and   had   hit   him   on   his   head   with   a   stone.     It 

             appears that the condition of the deceased deteriorated 

             on   the   25th  of   July,   1992   and   though   he   was   taken   for 

             treatment to several hospitals, he ultimately died.  The

                                                                                               2






             dead body was subjected to a post mortem examination and 

             it   was   noted   that   there   was   no   external   injury   on   the 

             dead   body   and   that   the   death   had   been   caused   by   intra 

             cranial and extra cerebral haemmorhage in the brain.  


             3.                The trial court on a consideration of the evidence 

             of P.Ws. 3 and 7, (the other eye witnesses having been 

             declared   hostile),   found   that   the   prosecution   story 

             could   not   be   believed.     The   trial   court,   accordingly, 

             acquitted   the   appellant.     The   High   Court,   has,   in 

             appeal,   reversed   the   judgment   of   the   trial   court   and 

             relying   on   the   evidence   of   P.Ws.   3   and   7   as   also   the 

             medical   evidence   has   convicted   him   under   
Section   304 

             (II)
   of   the   IPC   and   sentenced   him   to   seven   years 

             rigorous imprisonment.  It is in this situation that the 

             matter is before us after the grant of special leave.


             4.                We have heard Mr. Pradip Ghosh, the learned Senior 

             Counsel   for   the   appellant   and   Mr.   Satish   Vig,   the 

             learned counsel for the State of West Bengal.  


             5.                Mr. Ghosh has first argued that the statements of 

             P.Ws.   3   and   7   could   not   be   believed   as   they   were 

             interested witnesses and as the incident had happened in 

             the   middle   of   a   local   street,   the   prosecution   should 

             have   produced   some   independent   witnesses   from   that 

             location.     He   has   further   argued   that   the   medical 

             evidence did not support the ocular version and that in

                                                                                               3






             any event a case under 
Section 304 (II)
 of the IPC was 

             not made out and if at all the conviction ought to have 

             been recorded under 
Section 325
 thereof.


             6.                Mr.   Satish   Vig   has,   however,   supported   the 

             judgment of the High Court.



             7.                We have absolutely no reason to doubt the presence 

             of   P.Ws.   3   and   7.     Although   there   appears   to   be   some 

             delay in the lodging of the FIR, this can be explained 

             by the fact that the dispute was within the family and, 

             initially, in the absence of any external injury, it did 

             not   appear   that   any   serious   damage   had   been   caused   to 

             the   deceased   and   it   was   only   after   his   condition   had 

             declined   rapidly   that   the   First   Information   Report   had 

             been   lodged.     We   also   see   that   in   a   family   dispute 

             independent witnesses   are reluctant to come forward to 

             give evidence.    We, however, feel that in the facts of 

             the   case   the   conviction   under   
Section   304   (II)
   was 

             wrong.  We have gone through the evidence  of P.W. 8 Dr. 

             Bibhuti Baran Senapati who had conducted the autopsy on 

             the   dead   body.     He   found   a   bilateral   peri   orbital 

             haematoma   on   the   opening   of   the   skull   and   no   external 

             injury   was   present.       He   also   noted   that   the   cause   of 

             the   death   was   intra   cranial   haemmorhage.     When   cross 

             examined the doctor deposed that if somebody was hit by 

             a stone or hard substance it was likely that there would

                                                                                               4






             be some external injury.   Likewise, P.W. 9, Dr. Murari 

             Mohan   Kumar   who   had   examined   the   deceased   on   the   24th 

             July,   1992   emphatically   stated   that   there   was   no 

             external injury on the head and if there had been one it 

             could have been detected by a CT scan.  It has also come 

             in the evidence of P.W. 3 that after the appellant had 

             sat on the chest of her husband he had held his head and 

             repeatedly   hit   it   against   the   ground.     It   appears, 

             therefore, that the injuries caused were apparently not 

             with   a   stone   but   it   was   the   concussion   and   the   rough 

             handling by the appellant that had led to the internal 

             injury   to   the   brain   which   had   resulted   in   haematomal 

             haemmorhage   and   then   to   death.     We   are,   therefore,   of 

             the   opinion   that   the   matter   would   fall   squarely   under 

             
Section 325
 of the IPC.   We are told that the appellant 

             has undergone about two years of the sentence.   We feel 

             that the ends of justice would be met if the sentence is 

             reduced   from   seven   years   to   that   already   undergone   by 

             him.



             8.                The   appeal   stands   disposed   of   in   the   aforesaid 

             terms.
