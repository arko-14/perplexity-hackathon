RAJA MAHENDRAGIR DHANRAJGIR AND ORS.       Respondent(s)





                           O R D E R



       Leave granted.



       We   have   heard   the   learned   counsel   for   the 

parties. 



       Mr.   Sanyal,   learned   senior   counsel   appearing 

for   the   appellants   prays   for   some   time   to   file   a 

petition   under   Section   226   of   the   Constitution 

before   the   High   Court.   Let   the   petition   be   filed 

within four weeks from today. He also undertakes to 

implead   the   respondents   and   the   Union   of   India   in 

the writ petition to be filed before the High Court. 


       Mr.   Jaideep   Gupta,   learned   senior   counsel 

appearing for the respondents submits that the suit 

is  pending  before the  Small Causes Court,  Pune. 


                             -2-



We  direct   the  proceedings   in  the   suit  to   continue, 

however, no final order in the suit be passed until 

the disposal of the writ petition to be filed by the 

appellants before the Bombay High Court. 


       In the facts and circumstances of the case, we 

request the Bombay High Court to dispose of the writ 

petition,   if   filed   (by   the   appellants   within   four 

weeks   from   today)   as   expeditiously   as   possible,   in 

any event, within a period of one year from the date 

of filing of the writ petition.  


       In case, the writ petition is not filed within 

a   period   of   four   weeks,   this   order   would   be   of   no 

avail to the appellants.   



       With   these   observations,   this   appeal   is 

disposed  of,   leaving  the   parties  to   bear  their   own 

costs.   



                                       .....................J
