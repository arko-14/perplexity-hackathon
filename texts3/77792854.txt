CIVIL APPEAL NO. 1264 OF 2009
      Heard learned Counsel for the parties.




      This   Appeal   has   been   filed   against   the   impugned   Judgment   dated 

8.10.2007 passed by the High Court of Allahabad.





      The appellant herein is a landlord of premises in question and the 

respondent is the tenant.  The appellant filed a Petition under Section 

21(1)(a) of U.P. Urban Building Act, 1972 alleging that he has bonafide 

need   of   the   premises   and   hence   the   tenant   should   be   evicted.     The 

prescribed   authority   found   that   the   landlord   could   not   establish   his 

bonafide need and hence it rejected the Petition.  The tenant filed an 

appeal and the Appellate Court has upheld the finding that there is no 

bonafide need of the premises of the landlord.






                                            -2-


      Surprisingly,   the   High   Court   while   upholding   the   finding   that 

there is no bonafide need of the landlord has allowed the Writ Petition 

by the impugned Judgment dated 8.10.2007 by increasing the rent.  





      It   is   well   settled   that   a   High   Court   in   Writ   Petition   cannot 

interfere with the finding of fact, regarding bonafide need.

  


      We   are   also   of   the   opinion   that   under   Section   21,   there   is   no 

question   of   enhancement   of   rent.   That   may   be   done   under   some   other 

provision of the Act.  





      Accordingly, we dispose of this appeal with the direction that the 

impugned  Judgment is  set aside  and Judgment  of First  Appellate Court 

rejecting   the   Petition   under   Section   21   is   upheld.     The   direction 

increasing rent is set aside.





      The appeal is disposed of accordingly.




CIVIL APPEAL NO. 1073 OF 2009




      This   Appeal   has   been   filed   against   the   impugned   Judgment   dated 

8.10.2007 passed by the High Court of Allahabad.


      The facts have been set out in the impugned judgment and hence we 

are not repeating the same here.



                                           -3-


      Under   Section   21(1)(a)   of   U.P.   Urban   Buildings   Act,   1972,   the 


prescribed authority can either allow the Petition for eviction of the 

tenant or it can refuse to do so.   It cannot enhance the rent under 

those proceedings.   Hence, we set aside the impugned Judgment of the 

High Court.






    The appeal is allowed with no order as to costs.
