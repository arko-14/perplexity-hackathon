              IN THE SUPREME COURT OF INDIA
             CRIMINAL  APPELLATE JURISDICTION 



           CRIMINAL APPEAL NO. 631   OF  2011

         (Arising out of SLP(Crl.) No.8236/2008)



GHANSHYAM                                  Appellant(s)

                     :VERSUS:

STATE OF MAHARASHTRA                       Respondent(s)





                          O R D E R



       Application for impleadment is allowed.

       Leave granted.



       The appellant was charged for having committed 

offence punishable under 
Sections 420
, 
468
 & 
471
 of 

the   Indian Penal Code (
I.P.C
.). The Chief Judicial 

Magistrate at Beed (Maharashtra), after trial of the 

case,   convicted   the   appellant   under   all   the   three 

Sections   and   sentenced   him   to   undergo   simple 

imprisonment  for   one  year   and  a   fine  of   Rs.5,000/- 

under   Section   420   of   the   I.P.C.   and   to   further 

undergo   simple   imprisonment   for   six   months   and   to 

pay   a   fine   of   Rs.5000/-   separately   under   Sections 

468 and 471 of the I.P.C. 





                             2


       The   Sessions   Judge,   Beed,   however,   acquitted 

the   appellant   for   the   offence   punishable   under 

Section   468   of   the   I.P.C.   but   maintained   the 

conviction   and   sentence   of   the   appellant   under 

Sections 420 and 471 of the I.P.C. 





       The appellant filed a revision before the High 

Court which was dismissed, affirming the conviction 

and sentence of the appellant under Sections 420 and 

471 of the I.P.C. 





       Admittedly,   the   entire   amount   of   Rs.60,000/- 

involved   in   the   case,   has   been   deposited   by   the 

appellant. 





       The   Chief   Executive   Officer   of   the   Zila 

Parishad, Beed, has filed an application before this 

Court in which it is mentioned that since the entire 

amount   has   been   deposited   by   the   appellant,   they 

have no objection if the sentence under 
Section 420
 

of  the   I.P.C.  is   compounded.    The  alleged   incident 

took   place   23   years   ago   and   the   appellant   has 

already undergone a part of the sentence.


       We   have   heard   the   learned   counsel   for   the 



                              3



appellant, learned counsel for the State and learned 

counsel for the complainant. In our considered view, 

ends of justice would meet if,   while upholding the 

conviction of the appellant, the sentence is reduced 

to   the   period   already   undergone   by   him.   We   direct 

accordingly. 





       This   order   is   subject   to   the   appellant's 

paying additionally a fine of Rupees One Lakh within 

six   weeks   from   today.   This   appeal   is   disposed   of 

with these observations and directions. 





       In case the amount of fine, as directed above 

is  not   deposited  by   the  appellant,   then  this   order 

would be of no avail to the appellant and he would 

have to serve out the remaining period of sentence.
