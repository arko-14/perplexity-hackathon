                IN THE SUPREME COURT OF INDIA

               CRIMINAL APPELLATE JURISDICTION 



             CRIMINAL APPEAL NO. 526    OF 2011

         (Arising out of SLP(Crl.) No.10302/2010)

DAYAL DAS                              Appellant(s)

                     :VERSUS:

DALVEER BHANDARI, J.



1.     Delay condoned. Leave granted.



2.     We   have   heard   the   learned   counsel   for   the 

parties at length. 





3.     This   appeal   emanates   from   the   judgment   and 

order dated 25th  May, 2006 passed by the High Court 

of   Judicature   at   Rajasthan,   Jaipur   Bench,   in 

Criminal   Appeal   No.356   of   1984   by   which   the   High 

Court   has   affirmed   the   order   of   conviction   and 

sentence passed by the Trial Court. 



                              2


4.     Brief   facts   which   are   relevant   to   dispose   of 

this appeal are recapitulated as under:


       On 26.8.1979 at 11.30 a.m., the Station House 

Officer, Police Station, Clock Tower, Ajmer recorded 

the   Parcha   Bayan   (Ext.34)   of   Bheru   Lal,   PW-12   in 

Jawahar Lal Nehru Hospital, Ajmer. According to the 

Parcha Bayan, on 23.8.1979 at about 8.45 p.m., while 

he   was   standing   outside   the   New   Majestic   Cinema, 

Hari Singh, Band Master and Ram Niwas came out from 

the shop of Soda Lemon belonging to Dayal Das Sindhi 


-   appellant   herein.   Both   were   known   to   him   (Bheru 

Lal). All these persons consumed liquor at the shop 

of   the   said   Dayal   Das   Sindhi.   While   they   were 

consuming   liquor   at   the   shop   of   Dayal   Das   Sindhi, 

one   Lal   Chand   Thelewala   was   also   seen   drinking 

liquor in the said shop. 





5.     Bheru   Lal   became   unconscious   and   when   he 

regained consciousness on the next morning, he found 

himself   in   the   hospital   and   there   he   learnt     that 

Lal  Chand   had  died   because  of   consuming  of   illicit 

liquor. 





6.     On  the   basis  of   the  Parcha   Bayan,  the   Police 



                              3



Officer   registered   the   First   Information   Report 

("FIR"   for   short)   and   started   investigation.   After 

investigation   it   was   found   that   seven   persons, 

namely,   Lal   Chand,   Arjun,   Bhagwan,   Chaman   Das, 

Dhanna, Jethanand and Suresh Rawat lost their lives 

due to consuming of illicit liquor. 





7.     The   Additional   Sessions   Judge,   Ajmer,   after 

trial   of   this   case   delivered   the   judgment   on 

7.8.1984   in   Sessions   Case   No.3/1980   convicting   the 

appellant   Dayal   Das   under   Section   304   Part-II   and 

Section   328   of   the   Indian   Penal   (
IPC
)   Code   and 


Section   54-A
   of   the   Rajasthan   Excise   Act.   He   was 

sentenced   to   undergo   rigorous   imprisonment   for   ten 

years   and   a   fine   of   Rs.4,000/-   under   Section   304 

Part-II of the 
IPC
 and he was further convicted and 

sentenced to simple imprisonment for three years and 

imposed   a   fine   of   Rs.3000/-   under   
Section   54-A
   of 

the   Rajasthan   Excise   Act.   However,   both   the 

sentences were directed to run concurrently. 





8.     The   appellant   aggrieved   by   the   said   judgment 

of   the   Additional   Sessions   Judge,   preferred   an 

appeal   before   the   Rajasthan   High   Court.   The   High 



                              4



Court   in   the   impugned   judgment   has   upheld   the 

judgment of the Trial Court.   





9.     The   Trial   Court   and   the   High   Court 

concurrently   held   that   the   deceased   Lal   Chand   had 

purchased   illicit   liquor   from   the   shop   of   the 

appellant   Dayal   Das   Sindhi   and   drinking   of   that 

illicit liquor at the shop of the appellant was the 

cause of  death of Lal Chand.  





10.    Mr.  D.N.   Goburdhan,  learned   counsel  appearing 

for   the   appellant   as   amicus   curiae   made   threshold 

submission   that   both   the   judgments   of   the   Trial 

Court   and   the   High   Court   are   perverse   because   the 

evidence of Bheru Lal, PW-12 has not been correctly 

read   and   appreciated     by   both   the   Courts   below. 

According   to   Mr.   Goburdhan,   in   the   entire   evidence 

of   PW-12,   it   is   nowhere   mentioned   that   illicit 

liquor was purchased by the deceased Lal Chand from 

the shop of Dayal Das Sindhi. All what is mentioned 

in the statement is that he saw Lal Chand drinking 

in the shop of  Dayal Das Sindhi. It is difficult to 

connect   the   accused   with   the   crime   only   on   the 

evidence   that   Lal   Chand   was   seen   drinking   at   the 



                               5



shop of Dayal Das Sindhi. 





11.    We have ourselves read the original statement 

of   Bheru   Lal,   PW-12   but   could   not   find   from   the 

statement that the deceased Lal Chand had purchased 

illicit liquor from the shop of the appellant. This 

part   of   the   testimony   of   Bherulal   has   led   to   the 

conviction of the appellant but the same is totally 

missing   from   the   original   statement   of   Bheru   Lal, 

PW-12.   Consequently,   the   appellant   cannot   be 

connected   with   the   crime   on   the   basis   of   the 

statement of PW-12. 





12.    It  may   be  pertinent   to  mention   here  that   the 

other   two   witnesses,   namely,   Hari   Singh,   PW-9   and 

Ram Niwas, PW-13 had turned hostile during the trial 

of   this   case.   It   may   also   be   pertinent   to   mention 

that the liquor consumed by Lal Chand at the shop of 

the  appellant   Dayal  Das,   was  not   sent  for   chemical 

examination. Only on the basis of the statement made 

by Bheru Lal, PW-12, that the deceased Lal Chand was 

drinking   at   the   shop   of   Dayal   Das   Sindhi,   it   is 

difficult to sustain the conviction of the appellant 

under Section 304 Part-II of the 
IPC
. 



                              6


13.    Learned   counsel   appearing   for   the   State   of 

Rajasthan   fairly   submitted   that   in   the   entire 

evidence of Bheru Lal, PW-12, he had nowhere stated 

that the deceased Lal Chand purchased illicit liquor 

from the shop of Dayal Das Sindhi.  





14.    On a careful reading of the original statement 

of   Bheru   Lal,   PW-12,   we   have   no   hesitation   in 

arriving   at   the   conclusion   that   both   the   Sessions 

Court  and   the  High   Court  have   erroneously  read   and 

comprehended   the   statement   of   Bheru   Lal,   PW-12   and 

unfortunately that has led to the conviction of the 

appellant. 





15.    In this view of the matter, we are left with 

no option but to set aside the impugned judgment of 

the   High   Court   as   also   the   judgment   of   the   Trial 

Court. Consequently, the conviction of the appellant 

is set aside and he is directed to be released from 

jail   forthwith   unless   required   in   connection   with 

any other case. 





16.    The   appeal   filed   by   the   appellant   is   allowed 



                              7



and disposed of accordingly. 





17.    The   appellant   was   not   represented   by   any 

counsel and this Court had to appoint amicus curiae 

in this matter. Therefore, we direct that copies of 

this   Judgment/order   be   sent   to   all   concerned 

authorities forthwith for compliance of the order. 





18.    Before   parting   with   this   case,   we   would   like 

to   place   on   record   our   appreciation   for   very   able 

assistance   provided   to   us   by   the   learned   amicus 

curiae Mr. D.N. Goburdhan,Advocate.
