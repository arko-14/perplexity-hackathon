                CRIMINAL  APPELLATE JURISDICTION
   
                 CRIMINAL APPEAL NO. 749 OF 2007



BALDEV SINGH & ORS.                        ......Appellant (s)

                   Versus

STATE OF PUNJAB                           .....Respondent  (s)  



                          O R D E R



         This   appeal   has   been   filed   against   the   impugned 

judgment dated 27.0.2005 IN CRLA No. 242 of 1999 of the 

High Court of Punjab & Haryana at Chandigarh.   


         The   facts   of   the   case   have   been   set   out   in   the 

judgment   of   the   High   Court   and   hence   we   are   not 

repeating the same here, except where necessary. 


         The   prosecution   case   is   that   on   03.03.1997   at 

about 6.30 A.M. the prosecutrix was coming to her house 

after answering the call of nature. The three appellants 

caught her and took her into a house and raped her and 

beat   her.     After   police   investigation   the   appellants 

were charge sheeted,   and after a trial were convicted 

under   Section   376   (2)   (g)   and   
Section   342
     I.P.C.   and 

sentenced   to   10   years   R.I.   and   to   pay   a   fine   of   Rs. 

1,000/-   each.     The   sentence   was   upheld   by   the   High 

Court, and hence this appeal.  



         Admittedly the appellants have already undergone, 

about 3 and = years imprisonment each.  The incident is 

14   years   old.     The   appellants   and   the   prosecutrix   are 


married  (not to each other).  The prosecutrix  has also

two   children.     An   application   and   affidavit   has   been 

filed before us stating that the parties want to finish 

the   dispute,   have   entered   into   a   compromise   on 

01.09.2007,   and   that   the   accused   may   be   acquitted   and 

now there is no misunderstanding between them.  


 
Section   376
   is   a   non   compoundable   offence, 

However, the fact that  the incident is an old one, is a 

circumstance for invoking the proviso to 
Section 376 (2)


(g) and awarding a sentence less than 10 years, which is 

ordinarily the minimum sentence under that provision, as 

we think that there are adequate and special reasons for 

doing so.  



        On   the   facts   of   the   case,   considering   that   the 

incident happened in the year 1997 and that the parties 

have themselves entered into a compromise, we uphold the 

conviction  of the  appellant but  we reduce  the sentence 

to the period of sentence already undergone in view of 

the   proviso   to   
Section   376   (2)   (g)
   which   for   adequate 

and   special   reasons   permits   imposition   of   a   lesser 

sentence.  However, we direct that each of the appellant 

will pay a sum of Rupees 50,000/- by way of enhancement 

of fine to the victim envisaged under 
Section 376
 of the 


IPC itself.  The fine shall be paid within three months 

from today.  In the event of failure to pay the enhanced 

amount of fine it will be recovered as arrears of land 

revenue and will be given to the victim.  






                            -3-


       The appeal is disposed off.
