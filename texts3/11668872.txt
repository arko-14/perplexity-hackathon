                           IN THE SUPREME COURT OF INDIA

              CRIMINAL APPELLATE JURISDICTION


               CRIMINAL APPEAL NO. 810 OF 2004


SHARADBHAI JIVANLAL VANIYA                           .... APPELLANT


                               Versus


STATE OF GUJARAT                                       .... RESPONDENT


                                 O R D E R 



1.    The   appellant   was   put   on   trial   for   commission   of   the 



offence   under   Sections   498-A   and   304-B   read   with   
Section 



114
   of   the   Indian   Penal   Code.     Additional   Sessions   Judge, 



Rajkot,   by   judgment   dated   22nd  of   January,   1997   passed   in 



Sessions   Case   No.138   of   1991,   acquitted   the   appellant. 



Aggrieved   by   the   same,   State   of   Gujarat   preferred   Criminal 



Appeal No. 335 of 1997 and the High Court by the impugned 



judgment dated 6th of May, 2004 and 23rd June, 2004 set aside 



the   order   of   acquittal   and   convicted   the   appellant   for   offence 



under   
Section   306
   of   the   Indian   Penal   Code   and   sentenced 



him   to   suffer   rigorous   imprisonment   for   five   years.     He   was 



also   held   guilty   of   offence   under   
Section   498-A
   of   the   Indian 



Penal  Code  and  sentenced   to  undergo  rigorous  imprisonment 



for one and a half years.  



                                      2


2.    Aggrieved   by   the   same,   the   appellant   has   preferred   this 



appeal.



3.    According   to   the   prosecution,   appellant   had   married 



Binaben,   the   daughter   of   Jaysukhlal   about   two   years   before 



her death.  She was ill-treated by the appellant and his mother 



Jayaben   for   demand   of   dowry   and   for   that   reason   on   2nd  of 



June,   1990,   Binaben   committed  suicide   by   setting   herself   on 



fire.     A case was registered and after investigation, the police 



submitted   charge-sheet   against   the   appellant.   Ultimately   he 



was committed to the Court of Sessions where he was charged 



of   offence   punishable   under   
Section   498-A
   and   
304-B
   read 



with 
Section 114
 of the Indian Penal Code.  The Trial Court on 



appreciation   of   evidence   held   that   there   is   no   evidence   of 



cruelty   or   harassment   in   connection   with   demand   of   dowry 



and accordingly acquitted him on both the counts.  On appeal 



by   the   State,   as   stated   earlier,   the   High   Court   reversed 



the   finding   of   acquittal   and   convicted   the   appellant 



as above.   While    reversing    the    judgment    of    acquittal, 



                                       3




the High Court has relied upon a letter (Ex.-21) written by the 



deceased to her sister-in-law.   In the said letter, the deceased 



has stated that her husband had beaten her and asked her to 



take  divorce.    Further   the   appellant  is  pressing   hard  to  leave 



the matrimonial home and go to Jamnagar, her parental place.



4.    Mr. Nanavati, learned counsel appearing on behalf of the 



appellant   submits   that   the   letter   which   forms   the   basis   of 



conviction by the Appellate Court was never produced  during 



the investigation and for the first time produced by the witness 



during the course of trial, when she appeared as a witness.  It 



is submitted that authenticity of the letter in question has not 



been proved and hence the appellate Court ought not to have 



reversed   the   judgment   of   acquittal   and   convicted   the 



appellant.     
In   support   of   the   submission,   reliance   has   been 



placed on a decision of this Court in  
Anand Kumar vs. State 


of Madhya Pradesh
  (2009) 3 SCC 799 and our attention has 


been drawn to the following paragraph of this judgment :




            9.     "....     ....Moreover, this letter had not been  

      produced   before   the   police   during   the   course   of   the  

      initial investigation and had been handed over to the  

      police   after   several   months.     This   fact,   as   also   a  

      reading   of   the   letter,   indicates   that   this   was   a  



                                        4




      concocted   piece  of   evidence   and   the   work   of   a   legal  

      mind, as no person would write such a letter meeting  

      all legal requirements for implicating  himself and his  

      near relatives, in a claim for dowry."





It has also been pointed out that view taken by the Trial Court 



was one of the possible views which the High Court in appeal 



ought not to have reversed.  



5.    Ms.   Jesal,   learned   counsel   appearing   on   behalf   of   the 



respondent,   however,   submits   that   the   letter   written   by   the 



deceased   to   her   sister-in-law   clearly   shows   cruelty   and 



harassment   due   to   demand   of     dowry   and   the   High   Court 



rightly reversed the order of acquittal to that of conviction.



6.    We   have   bestowed   our   consideration   to   the   rival 



submissions and we find  substance in the submission  of Mr. 



Nanavati and the judgment relied on supports his submission. 



7.    As  observed  earlier,   the   High   Court   reversed  the   finding 



of   acquittal   mainly   relying   on   the   letter   written   by   the 



deceased   to   her   sister-in-law.     The   said   letter   was   not 



produced   during   the   course   of   investigation   and   there   is 



                                          5




nothing on record to establish its authenticity.   It is produced 



by the prosecution only during the course of evidence.   In our 



opinion, the order of acquittal ought not to have been reversed 



relying   on   unauthenticated   letter.     We   are   further   of   the 



opinion that the view taken by the Trial Court while acquitting 



the  appellant   was one  of  the  possible  views.     In view of  what 



we   have   observed   above,   we   feel   it   unsafe   to   sustain   the 



conviction of the appellant and give him the benefit of doubt. 



The   appellant   is   on   bail.       He   shall   be   discharged   of   his   bail 



bonds.



8.     In the result, the appeal is allowed, impugned judgment 



of   conviction   and   sentence   is   set   aside   with   the   direction 



aforesaid. 



                                        ................................................J.
