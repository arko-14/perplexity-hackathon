                             IN THE SUPREME COURT OF INDIA

                   CIVIL APPELLATE JURISDICTION

                   CIVIL APPEAL NO. 2719 OF 2007


DAV COLLEGE MANAGING COMMITTEE                      .......APPELLANT 


                                         Versus


SURENDER RANA & ANR.                                .....RESPONDENTS



                              O R D E R



                 The   first   respondent   was   appointed   on 

1.8.1996, as Store Keeper, on probation for a period of one 

year,   by   the   appellant,   which   runs   a   private   unaided 

school.  He was removed from service on 1.7.1997 by giving 

a month's salary in lieu of notice.   The first respondent 

challenged his removal by filing an appeal before the Delhi 

School   Tribunal.  The   said  appeal   was  allowed   on  15.1.2002 

and the order of removal was set aside on the ground that 

the   appellant   had   not   taken   the   prior   permission   of   the 

Director   of   Education.     The   writ   petition   filed   by   the 

appellant   challenging   the   said   order,   was   dismissed   by   a 

learned single Judge of the High Court on 8.2.2006 and the 

appeal   filed   by   the   appellant   was   also   dismissed   by   a 

Division Bench on 30.11.2006.  The said order is challenged 

in this appeal by special leave.





2.               Rule 105 of the Delhi School Education Rules, 

1973 deals   with   probation  and  prescribes  the  period 


of 

       .....2.





                                  - 2 -






probation.  The second proviso to sub-Rule (1) of Rule 105 

clearly   provides   that   no   termination   from   service,   of   an 

employee on probation shall be made by a school, other than 

a minority school, except with the previous approval of the 

Director.





3.                  The appellant does not dispute the fact that 

it is not a minority school.  Therefore, the second proviso 

to     Rule   105(1)  applies   to  the   order  of   removal  of   first 

respondent from service.





4.                  In   the   circumstances,   the   orders   of   the 

Tribunal   and   the   High   Court   holding   that   the   termination 

without   the   previous   approval   of   the   Director   under   Rule 

105   was   illegal,   does   not   call   for   interference.     The 

appeal is dismissed.

RAVEENDRAN )
