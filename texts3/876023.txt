                     IN THE SUPREME COURT OF INDIA

                     CIVIL APPELLATE JURISDICTION

                   CIVIL APPEAL NO(s).1894 OF 2011
                (Arising out of SLP(C) No.7350/2007)




STATE OF UTTARAKHAND AND OTHERS                        ...Appellant(s)

                              VERSUS

HARPAL SINGH RAWAT                                     ...Respondent(s)

What should be the stamp duty payable on lease agreement 

executed   between   appellant   No.1   and   the   respondent   entitling 

the latter to collect toll tax is the question which arises for 

consideration in this appeal filed against the order passed by 

the   Division   Bench   of   the   Uttarakhand   High   Court   whereby   the 

writ petition filed by the respondent was disposed of in terms 

of the judgments of the Allahabad High Court in 
Tejveer Singh 

v. State of Uttar Pradesh
 1997 (29) ALR 687 and the Uttarakhand 

High   Court   in   Writ   Petition   No.1020   of   2004   (M/B)   -   Naresh 

Agarwal v. State of Uttaranchal.




 
The   respondent   participated   in   the   auction   held   by 



                                    2




Executive   Engineer,   Construction   Division,   PWD,   Haldwani 

(appellant No.2 herein) for grant on lease collection of toll 

tax for using Haldwani Bye-Pass Road, 14 K.M. (Kathgodam) Gaula 

bridge.     The   bid   of   Rs.22   lakhs   given   by   the   respondent   was 

accepted   by   the   competent   authority.   Thereafter,   lease 

agreement dated 24.3.2006 was executed between the Governor of 

Uttaranchal   (now   Uttarakhand)   through   Commissioner,   Kumaon 

Division   and   the   respondent   whereby   the   latter   was   given 

exclusive   right   to   collect   toll   from   the   vehicles   using   the 

road and Gaula bridge.  As a condition for execution of lease, 

communication dated 25.2.2006 was sent by appellant No.2 to the 

respondent   requiring   him   to   deposit   stamp   duty   of 

Rs.2,20,400/-.   However, instead of depositing the stamp duty, 

the   respondent   filed   Writ   Petition   No.204(M/B)   of   2006   for 

quashing the notice issued by appellant No.2 and also for issue 

of   a   direction   to   the   appellants   to   charge   stamp   duty   in 

accordance with the judgments in 
Tejveer Sing
's case and Naresh 

Agarwal's case by asserting that the contract executed between 

the parties was only a security bond and stamp duty was payable 

as   per   
Article   57
   of   
Schedule   I-B   of   Indian   Stamp   Act,   1899
 

(for short, `the Act'), as amended by the State of U.P. and as 

applicable to the State of Uttarakhand.


      The Division Bench of the High Court disposed of the writ 



                                   3




petition by recording a cryptic order, which reads thus:


 
"By   means   of   this   writ   petition,   the   petitioner 
      has   prayed   for   writ   of   certiorari   quashing   the 
      order   dated   25.2.2006   (Annexure   No.2)   passed   by 
      Respondent   no.2   and   further   a   writ   of   mandamus 
      commanding   the   respondent   not   to   demand/realize 
      stamp   duty   on   the   earnest   money/security   deposit 
      the money of contract as demanded on the basis of 
      the   Government   instructions   and   the   respondents 
      may be directed to demand stamp duty in pursuance 
      of the direction in the case of 
Tejveer Singh Vs. 
      State of U.P. and others
 reported in 1997 (29) ALR 
      Page   687   as   well   as   judgment   passed   by   this 
      Hon'ble Court in Writ Petition No.1020/2004 (M/B), 
      Naresh Agarwal Vs. State of Uttaranchal.




      2.A Division Bench of this Court has also followed 
      the aforesaid judgment, which is referred in the 
      prayer clause of the present writ petition.   The 
      controversy   raised   in   the   writ   petition   is 
      squarely covered by the aforementioned judgment as 
      submitted by learned Addl. Chief Standing Counsel. 
      Therefore,   the   writ   petition   is   disposed   of   in 
      terms   of   the   aforementioned   judgment   of   Hon'ble 
      Allahabad High Court."



      Learned   counsel   for   the   appellants   invited   our   attention 

to the contents of lease agreement dated 24.3.2006 to show that 

the   respondent   was   given   exclusive   right   to   collect   the   toll 

from 31.3.2006 to 30.3.2007 against the consideration of Rs.22 

lacs and argued that stamp duty on such lease is payable under 


Article 35
 of 
Schedule I-B of the Act
 and not under 
Article 57
 

thereof.   
In   support   of   this   argument,   the   learned   counsel 

relied   upon   judgments   of   the   Special   Bench   of   the   Allahabad 

High Court in 
Banney Khan versus Chief Inspector of Stamp, U.P.


                                   4




AIR   1976   Allahabad   475   and   a   Division   Bench   of   the   Andhra 

Pradesh High Court in 
Uppalapati Durga Prasad and others versus 

Executive   Engineer   (R&B)   N.H.   Division,   Srikakulam   and   others
 

2001   (4)   ALT   228.
 
Learned   counsel   then   submitted   that   stamp 

duty was demanded from the respondent keeping in view the terms 

of the lease agreement, which enabled him to collect toll tax 

and not on the security given by him for due performance of the 

contract   and   the   Division   Bench   of   the   High   Court   committed 

serious error by disposing of the writ petition in terms of the 

judgments in 
Tejveer Singh
's case and Naresh Agarwal's case.


      We have considered the argument/submission of the learned 

counsel.

      The   definition   of   `lease'   contained   in   
Section   2(16)
 

consists   of   two   parts.     The   first   part   is   applicable   to   any 

lease   with   respect   to   immovable   property.     The   second   part, 

which is inclusive, applies to various kinds of instruments by 

which a title, or other rights may be conferred upon the lessee 

for   a   specified   period   in   respect   of   immovable   property   or 

otherwise.   The use of the words "includes also" implies that 

the definition of lease contained in 
Section 2(16)(c)
 is very 



                                    7




wide   and   even   if   the   transaction   does   not   amount   to   a   lease 

under 
Section 105
 of the Transfer of Property Act, the same may 

nonetheless be a lease for the purpose of the Act.  


      The   acceptance   of   the   argument   made   on   behalf   of   the 

appellants   will   largely   depend   on   the   contents   of   auction 

notice dated 27.10.2005 issued by appellant No.2 and the lease 

agreement   executed   between   the   parties,   the   relevant   portions 

of which are extracted below:

      2.    The Lessee will deposit the amount equal to 
      three   monthly   installment   with   the   Executive 
      Engineer   of   Construction   Division,   P.W.D., 
      Haldwani, hereinafter will be called as Executive 
      Engineer   and   Executive   Engineer   will   keep   this 
      amount   with   him   as   partial   security   for 
      fulfilling and compliance of terms and conditions 
      of   agreement   prescribed   in   schedule   and   out   of 
      which   he   can   take   such   amount   as   rent   which 
      becomes   due   and   payable   or   can   deduct   such 
      amounts   of   penalties   from   that   which   may   be 
      imposed   upon   lessee   and   provision   of   which   has 
      been made hereinafter."



      A   conjoint   reading   of   the   auction   notice   and   the   lease 

agreement   makes   it   clear   that   tenders   were   invited   from   the 

public   for   grant   on   lease   collection   of   toll   tax   for   using 

Haldwani   Bye-Pass   Road   14   K.M.   (Kathgodam)   Gaula   bridge   and 

highest bid of Rs.22 lakhs given by the respondent was accepted 

by the competent authority.  The monthly amount payable by the 

respondent   was   lease   money   and   not   a   security   for   due 

performance of the contract.   Such an agreement clearly falls 

within   the   ambit   of   the   term   "lease"   as   defined   in   
Section 

2(16)(c)
 read with 
Article 35(b)
 of Schedule I-B and not under 


Article   57
   of   Schedule   I-B,   which   gets   attracted   only   when   a 

security bond or mortgage deed is executed for due execution of 

an office or to account for money or other property received by 

virtue thereof or for due performance of a contract or the due 



                                   11




discharge of a liability.  Therefore, the demand of stamp duty 

of   Rs.2,20,400/-   from   the   respondent   cannot   be   termed   as 

illegal.



 
In 
Banney Khan
's case, the Special Bench of the Allahabad 

High   Court   was   called   upon   to   consider   whether   the   lease 

executed   between   Municipal   Board,   Ujhani   and   the   appellant 

authorising the latter to collect toll from the premises known 

as "New Sabzimandi" was a lease falling under 
Section 2(16)
 of 

the   Act   was   chargeable   under   
Article   35(b)
   of   Schedule   I-B. 

The   Special   Bench   referred   to   the   definition   of   lease,   the 

judgments   of   the   Full   Bench   in   Burmah   Shell   Oil   Storage   and 

Distributing Co. Ltd. of India AIR 1933 All 735 and the Andhra 

Pradesh   High   Court   in   
Panchayat   Samiti   v.   Smt.   Kethavarapu 

Kanamma
 AIR 1973 AP 72 and observed:




      "................A   casual   reading   of   the 
      definition   of   "lease"   indicates   that   any 
      instrument by which tolls of any description are 
      let   comes   within   the   definition   of   this   term. 
      What   is,   therefore,   to   be   seen   is   whether   the 
      document   is   an   instrument   by   which   tolls   of   any 
      description are let.  In our opinion the agreement 
      before us comes clearly within the language quoted 
      above.  This is a document by which all lands and 
      buildings   known   as   "New   Subzi   Mandi"   have   been 
      made over by the owners thereof to the applicant 
      for   a   period   of   one   year.     He   is   entitled   to 
      realise   fee   from   occupiers   thereof   at   certain 
      rates   in   consideration   of   a   sum   fixed   by   public 
      auction.  This "letting of tolls" and the document 
      is covered by 
Section 2(16)(c)
 of the Stamp Act. 
      It is needless to say that the word "toll" used in 



                                    12




      this sub-section means any sum of money which is 
      taken   in   respect   of   some   benefit,   the   benefit 
      being   the   temporary   use   of   land,   that   is,   fares 
      and   market   tolls.     It   includes   all   payments   or 
      taxes made by persons who frequent the market for 
      the   sale   of   any   commodity   or   any   thing   which   by 
      practice or custom is expected to be sold in the 
      market.     This   document   is   signed   both   by   the 
      lessor and the lessee.   Therefore, it can hardly 
      be   doubted   that   it   is   an   instrument   by   which 
      collection of tolls is let and is lease within the 
      meaning of 
Section 2(16)
 of the Stamp Act and is 
      chargeable   with   Stamp   duty   under   
Article   35(b)
 
      Schedule   I-B   of   the   U.P.   Stamp   (Amendment)   Act, 
      1962............."  



 
In   
Uppalapati   Durga   Prasad   v.   Executive   Engineer   (R&B
) 

(supra),   a   Division   Bench   of   the   Andhra   Pradesh   High   Court 

considered   a   similar   question   in   the   context   of   an   agreement 

signed   by   the   parties   in   the   matter   of   collection   of   toll. 

While rejecting the argument of the writ petitioner that he was 

not   liable   to   pay   stamp   duty   under   
Article   35(b)
   read   with 


Section 2(16)
 of the Act, the Division Bench observed:


      "On bare reading of the section it becomes clear 
      that all leases with respect to immovable property 
      would be leases in terms of 
Section 2(16)
 but in 
      addition to leases of immovable property in other 
      three categories there would also be lease under 
      category   (c)   in   which   any   instrument   by   which 
      tolls of any description are let would be a lease 
      for the purpose of 
Section 2(16)
.  The instrument 
      by which right to collect toll is conveyed has to 
      be treated as lease for the purposes of 
Stamp Act
. 
      Right   to   collect   toll   will   never   in   any 
      circumstances   involve   immovable   property. 
      Basically   toll   is   collected   for   using   a   road   or 
      bridge and as such neither the road nor the bridge 
      is   leased   out,   only   the   right   to   collection   is 



                                    13




      leased   out   and   this   right   of   leasing   out   the 
      collection   is   'lease'   for   the   purposes   of   
Stamp 
      Act
............."



      In our view, the aforementioned judgments of the Allahabad 

and   Andhra   Pradesh   High   Courts   represents   the   correct   legal 

position on the applicability of 
Article 35(b)
 of 
Schedule I-B 

of the Act
.



 
In   
Tejveer   Singh
's   case,   the   Division   Bench   of   the 

Allahabad High Court considered the question whether the amount 

offered   as   security   for   due   performance   of   the   contract   for 

construction   of   drains   culvert   etc.,   is   chargeable   under 


Article 57
 of Schedule I-B.  The Division Bench relied upon the 

judgment of Special Bench in M/s. 
Hindustan Sugar Mills Limited 

v.   State   of   U.P.
   AIR   1972   Allahabad   8   and   of   this   Court   in 


Board of Revenue v. A.M. Ansari
 (1976) 3 SCC 512 and held that 

the stamp duty on such agreement is to be paid under 
Article 57
 

of 
Schedule I-B of the Act
, as amended by the State of Uttar 

Pradesh.
 
The judgment in 
Tejveer Singh
's case was followed by 

the Division Bench of the Uttarakhand High Court in the case of 

Naresh   Agarwal.     These   two   judgments   have   no   bearing   on   the 

issue   raised   in   the   writ   petition   filed   by   the   respondent.


Therefore, it must be held that the Division Bench of the High 

Court committed serious error by disposing of the writ petition 

of   the   respondent   by   relying   upon   the   judgments   in   
Tejveer 



                                 14




Singh
's case and Naresh Agarwal's case, and that too, without 

even   adverting   to   the   lease   agreement   executed   between 

appellant No.1 and the respondent.




     In the result, the appeal is allowed, the impugned order 

is set aside and the writ petition filed by the respondent is 

dismissed.   The appellants shall now be free to recover stamp 

duty   from   the   respondent   in   terms   of   Notice   No.775   dated 

25.2.2006.       Since   no   one   has   appeared   on   behalf   of   the 

respondent, the costs are made easy.
