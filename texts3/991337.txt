A. K. PATNAIK, J.



      Leave granted.



2.    These are appeals against the order dated 24.09.2007 



of   the   Division   Bench   of   the   High   Court   of   Delhi   in   L.P.A. 



No.1098 of 2006 and against the order dated 02.11.2007 of 



the   Division   Bench   of   the   High   Court   of   Delhi   in   Review 



Application No.396 of 2007.



3.    The   facts   giving   rise   to   these   appeals   briefly   are   that 



the appellant carries on the business of export of brass art-



wares   and   other   Indian   handicrafts.     On   09.10.1991,   two 



Advance Licences were issued to the appellant for import of 



                                         2





240 MT's of brass dross/ash against each of the licences for 



the   C.I.F.   value   of   Rs.24,64,800/-   and   Rs.24,64,000/- 



respectively with the condition to export of 80 MT's of brass 



art-ware   against   each   of   the   licences   for   FOB   value   of   US 



dollars 2,37,082.95 and US dollars 2,38,545 within a period 



of 12 months.  As the appellant failed to discharge its export 



obligation under the licences, two show-cause notices dated 



26.09.1996 were issued to the appellant and its partners to 



show cause why penalty under 
Section 11(2)
 of the Foreign 



Trade   (Development   and   Regulation)   Act,   1992   (for   short 



`the  Act')  will   not  be  imposed on it.     Thereafter,  two  orders 



dated   24.05.2002   and   27.06.2002   were   passed   by   the 



Adjudicating           Authority         imposing         a         penalty         of 



Rs.1,30,00,000/-   in   respect   of   each   of   the   two   licences   on 



the   appellant   and   its   partners   under   
Section   11(2)
   of   the 



Act.     Aggrieved,   the   appellant   filed   two   appeals   before   the 



Appellate   Authority   against   the   two   orders   of   penalty. 



Alongwith the  appeals,  the  appellant also  filed applications 



for stay of recovery of the penalty amounts but the appellant 



was intimated to make pre-deposit of Rs.5,00,000/- towards 



the penalties after which the appeals will be decided by the 



                                    3





Appellate Authority on merits.  The appellant failed to make 



the   pre-deposit   of   Rs.5,00,000/-   and   consequently   the 



appeals were dismissed. 



4.    The   appellant   then   filed   Writ   Petition   (C)   No.8058   of 



2006 in the High Court of Delhi praying for setting aside the 



orders   of   the   Appellate   Authority   and   the   orders   of   the 



Adjudicating   Authority   and   for   directing   extension   of   time 



for making the pre-deposit of Rs.5,00,000/- and for granting 



extension to the appellant to meet its export obligations.  By 



order dated 18.05.2006, the learned Single Judge dismissed 



the writ petition.   The appellant challenged the order of the 



learned Single Judge before the Division Bench of the High 



Court in L.P.A. No.1098 of 2006.  The Division Bench of the 



High   Court   passed   the   impugned   order   dated   24.09.2007 



allowing the appellant to deposit a sum of Rs.20,00,000/- in 



each of the two appeals within 8 weeks and further directing 



that   on   such   deposits   being   made   the   Appellate   Authority 



may   dispose   of   the   appeals   on   merits.     Thereafter,   the 



appellant   filed   Review   Application   No.396   of   2007   which 



was   also   dismissed   by   the   impugned   order   dated 



02.11.2007 of the Division Bench of the High Court.



                                     4


5.    We have heard learned counsel for the parties and we 



are of the considered opinion that the Division Bench of the 



High Court should not have passed the impugned order for 



deposit of Rs.20,00,000/- for each of the appeals when the 



Appellate Authority had directed the appellant to make pre-



deposit for Rs.5,00,000/- for both the appeals.   The second 



proviso to sub-section (1) of 
Section 15
 of the Act states that 



in   the   case   of   an   appeal   against   a   decision   or   order 



imposing  a  penalty  or redemption  charges,  no such  appeal 



shall   be   entertained   unless   the   amount   of   the   penalty   or 



redemption   charges   has   been   deposited   by   the   appellant. 



The third proviso to sub-section (1) of 
Section 15
 of the Act, 



however, states "where  the  Appellate  Authority  is of opinion  



that the deposit to be made will cause undue hardship to the  



appellant,   it   may,   at   its   discretion,   dispense   with   such  



deposit either unconditionally or subject to such conditions as  



it may impose."  Hence, under the Act discretion is vested in 



the   Appellate   Authority   to   dispense   with   a   pre-deposit   of 



penalty   either   unconditionally   or   subject  to   such   condition 



as   the   Appellate   Authority   may   impose.     If   in   exercise   of 



such discretion, the Appellate Authority in the present case 



                                         5





dispensed  with the pre-deposit penalty of Rs.1,30,00,000/- 



in   each   of   the   two   appeals   subject   to   the   appellant 



depositing   a   sum   of   Rs.5,00,000/-,   the   Division   Bench   of 



the   Delhi   High   Court   ought   not   to   have   enhanced   the 



amount of pre-deposit to Rs.20,00,000/- for each of the two 



appeals.  



6.     As   the   two   appeals   of   the   appellant   have   not   been 



heard   on   merits,   we   set   aside   the   impugned   order   of   the 



Division Bench of the High Court of Delhi and the order of 



the   learned   Single   Judge   and   direct   that   in   case   the 



appellant deposits the sum of Rs.5,00,000/- as directed by 



the   Appellate   Authority   within   two  months   from   today,  the 



two   appellate   orders   of   the   Appellate   Authority   will   stand 



quashed   and   the   appeal   will   be   heard   on   merits   afresh   by 



the Appellate Authority.  



7.     With the aforesaid directions, the appeals are allowed. 



No costs.



                                                      .............................J.

                                                            (R. V. Raveendran)




                                                      .............................J.

                                                            (A. K. Patnaik)
