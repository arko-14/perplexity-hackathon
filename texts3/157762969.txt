                                                                       R D E R





                       Leave granted.



                       The   U.P.   Textile   Corporation   Limited,   the 

        appellant   herein   is,   as   of   today,   we   are   told,   a 

        defunct   organization   and   proceedings   before   the   Board 

        of   Industrial   and   Financial   Reconstruction   (BIFR)   are 

        going on.   The respondent, Suresh Kumar, was appointed 

        as   a   Deputy   Manager   (Export)   for   a   fixed   tenure   of 


three years  vide order dated  21th april, 1987.  As per 

this   order   his   services   would   come   to   an   end 

automatically   on   the   expiry   of   three   years   from   the 

date of his joining unless the term was extended as per 

Clause-1   thereof.   It   was   also   stipulated   in   the 

aforesaid order that the tenure of the appointment was 

terminable without assigning any reason on three months 

notice from either side or on payment of salary in lieu 





thereof.  Admittedly the respondent joined the services 

of   the   appellant   on   the   7th  September,   1987.   His 

services   were  however   terminated  vide   order  dated   26th 

April, 1989 on the ground that he was in the habit of 






                               -2-



remaining absent for long periods of time without prior 

approval and that he had been on unauthorized absence 

from March, 1989.     The order of 26th  April, 1989 was 

challenged   by   the   respondent   before   the   U.P.   Public 

Services Tribunal. The Tribunal vide its judgment dated 

7.5.1992   held   that   the   order   impugned   before   it   was 

stigmatic   inasmuch   that   it   referred   to   the   continued 

absence of the respondent over   a long period   and in 





this view of the matter it could not be sustained.  The 

relief of reinstatement with continuity of service and 

back   wages   was   accordingly   ordered   by   the   Tribunal. 

This order was challenged by the appellant-Corporation 

before the Allahabad High Court.  The writ petition has 

been dismissed vide judgment dated 21.5.2007 on similar 

grounds.   It is in this background that the matter is 

before us.





             The   learned   counsel   for   the   appellant   has 

raised   primarily   two   arguments   before   us.     He   has 

contended   that   the   reference   to   the   unauthorized 

absence   of   the   respondent   could   not   in   any   manner   be 

said   to   be     stigmatic   and   that   the   finding   to   the 

contrary   was   unsustainable.     Alternatively   he   has 

contended   that   the   respondent   had   joined   the   post   on 

the   7th  September,   1987   for   a   period   of   three   years 





which would have come to an end on the 6th September, 






                                -3-


1990 and as such the direction for reinstatement could 

not have been granted to him.  It has been pleaded that 


as a   consequence of the order of the Tribunal and of 

the High Court, the respondent has been put back into 

service.



        The   learned   counsel   for   the   respondent   has 

however supported the judgments of the Tribunal and the 

High Court. 



             In the facts of the case we need not examine 

the   effect   of   the   order   dated   26th  April   1989   whereby 





the services of the respondent had been terminated as 

being stigmatic or not as we are of the opinion that in 

the light of the fact that appointment itself was for a 

fixed period of three years which would have come to an 

end   on   the   6th  September,   1990,   no   relief   beyond   that 

period could have been given to the respondent by the 

Tribunal or the High Court.   We accordingly feel that 

these   orders     need   to   be   modified   to   the   extent   that 


the   appellant   shall   be   deemed   to   be   in   service   up   to 

the   6th  September,   1990   and   not   thereafter.   The   other 

question relates to the  back wages for a period of one 

year   and   five   months.   We   are   of   the   opinion   that   the 

grant of back wages is a matter of discretion vested in 

the   Court   and   the   conduct   of   an   employee   is   an 

extremely   relevant   factor   on   this   aspect.     The 

financial status of the employer must also be kept in 






                            -4-





mind.  We are therefore of the opinion that the conduct 

of   the   respondent   and   the   financial   status   of   the 


      appellant   does   not   justify   the   payment   of   any   back 

      wages.  



                Accordingly,   we   allow     the   appeal   in   the   above 

      terms.
