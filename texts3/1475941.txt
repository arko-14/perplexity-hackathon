                    CIVIL APPEAL NO.1863 OF 2011
             [Arising out of SLP(C) No.2938 of 2011]


UNION OF INDIA & ANR.                                .......APPELLANTS 


                                           Versus


J. JASON JOSEPH                                        .....RESPONDENT




                                O R D E R



                  Leave granted.  Heard.



2.                The   respondent   was   a   Travelling   Ticket 

Inspector   in   the   Southern   Railway.   In   regard   to   seven 

charges, as per charge memo dated 19.2.1997, a departmental 

inquiry   was   held   and   the   Inquiry   Officer   submitted   an 

report dated 13.6.2002 holding that the charges were proved 

(except   a   part   of   the   charge   No.2).     The   disciplinary 

authority   accepted   the   inquiry   report   and   imposed   the 

punishment   of   dismissal   on   the   respondent   by   order   dated 

26.7.2002.     The   respondent   filed   an   appeal   and   the 

appellate authority, by order dated 20.2.2003, allowed the 

appeal   of   the   employee   in   part.     The   appellate   authority 

held   that   only   charges   1,6   and   7   were   proved   and   charges 

2,3,4 and 5 were not proved.   He was of the view that the 

punishment   of   dismissal   was   excessive   in   respect   of   the 

proved   charges  and,   therefore,  he   set  aside   the  dismissal 

and   imposed  the  punishment  of  reduction in rank from 



                                   2





TTE in the time scale of Rs. 5000 to 8000 to senior TC in 

the time scale of 4000 to 6000 for a period of three years 

(recurring)   subject   to   the   condition   that   the   period 

between   the   date   of   dismissal   to   date   of   reinstatement 

shall be treated as period under suspension.   The General 

Manager, in exercise of his revisional power, after giving 

an opportunity to the respondent to show cause, revised the 

order of the Appellate Authority and passed an order dated 

8.9.2005   increasing   the   punishment   to   dismissal.   He   held 

that even in regard to charges 1, 6 and 7 which were held 

to   be   proved,   the   respondent   deserved   the   punishment   of 

dismissal. 





3.                Feeling aggrieved, the respondent approached 

the   Central   Administrative   Tribunal   and   challenged   the 

punishment.     The   Tribunal,   by   order   dated   30.5.2007, 

dismissed the original application filed by the respondent 

and   confirmed   the   punishment   imposed.     However,   the 

subsequent   writ   petition   filed   by   the   respondent 

challenging   the   order   of   the   Tribunal   was   allowed   by   the 

Madras High Court, by the impunged order dated 22.10.2010. 

The   High   Court   was   of   the   view   that   the   revisional 

authority   was   not   justified   in   interfering   with   the 

decision of the appellate authority.  As a consequence, the 

High   Court   set   aside   the   order   of   the   Tribunal   and   the 

revisional   authority   and   restored   the   order   of   the 

appellate   authority   with   the   consequential   benefits   of 



                                   3





continuity of service, seniority and 25% of the backwages. 

The   said   order   is   challenged   in   this   appeal   by   special 

leave.





4.                The   learned   counsel   for   the   appellant 

submitted   that   there   was   no   justification   for   the   High 

Court,   in   exercise   of   power   of   judicial   review,   to 

interfere with the findings of the revisional authority and 

the   punishment   imposed,   which   had   been   accepted   by   the 

Administrative   Tribunal.   He   also   contended   that   the   High 

Court having confirmed the finding that the charges 1,6 and 

7   against   the   respondent   were   proved,   the   direction   for 

payment   of   25%   backwages   would   amount   to   rewarding   the 

guilty, which is impermissible in law.  





5.       The revisional authority did not interfere with the 

findings   recorded   by   the   appellate   authority   that 

respondent   was   not   guilty   of   charges   2,3,4   and   5.   The 

appellate   authority   found   that   as   only   charges   1,6   and   7 

were   proved   and   the   other   charges   relating   mis-

appropriation   of   additional   fare   were   not   proved,   the 

punishment of dismissal was excessive and consequently set 

aside the same and imposed a lesser punishment of reduction 

in rank. On the facts and circumstances, the said order of 

the   appellate   authority   did   not   call   for   interference   and 

that too in exercise of power of revision. Therefore we are 

of the view that the High Court was justified in restoring 

the   decision   of   the   appellate   authority   imposing   a   lesser 



                                     4





 punishment. 





6.   However while the High Court was justified in restoring 

the   order   of   reinstatement   with   imposition   of   lesser 

punishment   of   reduction   in   service   with   continuity     of 

service,   the   High   Court   was   not   justified   in   granting   the 

reliefs of seniority and 25% back wages. When the High Court 

has   upheld   the   finding   that   the   respondent   was   guilty   of 

charges 1,6 and 7, any direction for back wages would amount 

to rewarding the guilty, which is not permissible. Nor will he 

be   entitled   to   restoration   of   his   seniority   as   ordered     by 

the High Court.





 7.                In view of the above, we allow this appeal in 

 part   and   set   aside   the   order   of   the   High   Court   awarding 

 backwages of 25% and restoring the seniority. As a result of 

 setting aside of the punishment of dismissal the respondent 

 will   be   entitled   to   reinstatement   with   continuity   of 

 service, but shall be subjected to the punishment imposed by 

 the appellate authority. The respondent will not be entitled 

 to restoration of seniority or to any back wages.
