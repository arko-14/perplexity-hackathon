         RAJASEKARAN & ORS.                              ...... RESPONDENTS

       1.       This is rather an unfortunate case.   There were 

       five   accused   in   all   who   were   sentenced   by   the   trial 

       court for offences punishable under 
Section 376(2)(g)
, 

       
201
  of   the  Indian   Penal  Code   as  well   as  
Section   3(2)


       (v)   of   the   
Scheduled   Castes   and   Scheduled   Tribes 

       (Prevention  of  Atrocities)  Act,  1989
.    The  allegation 

       was   that   the   five   accused,   and   A1   in   particular,   who 

       was the main accused and involved with the deceased in 

       a clandestine relationship, had raped her on the night 

       intervening the 28 and 29th of January, 1999.  The trial 

       court in its judgment dated 31st  August, 2000 held the 

       case   against   the   accused   to   be   proved   and   they   were, 

       accordingly,   sentenced   to   death   under   section   302   or 

       
Section   302
/
34
   of   the   IPC   and   to   various   terms   of 

       imprisonment   under   the   various   other   sections   under 


Crl.A. 6-8 of 2004


                                             2






       which they had been charged.



       2.       An appeal was thereafter taken by the accused to 

       the  High   Court  and   a  reference   was  also   made  for   the 

       confirmation of the death sentence.  The High Court has 

       by its impugned judgment declined the reference and at 

       the   same   time   allowed   the   appeal   of   the   accused 

       acquitting them in toto.  



       3.       The   present   appeals   have   been   filed   at   the 

       instance   of   the   complainant   who   is   the   father   of   the 

       deceased.  We see from the record that A1 was the main 

       accused.   As per the death certificate which has been 

       put   on   record,   he   has   passed   away   on   the   30th  June, 

       2009.  The appeal qua him is, accordingly, abated.  We 

       have,   accordingly,   examined   the   evidence   with   respect 

       to A2 to A5.



       4.       We have gone through the evidence very carefully 

       keeping   in   view   the   gravity   of   the   offence.     We, 

       however, find that there is no evidence with respect to 

       the involvement of A2 to A5.  The High Court has taken 

       cognizance of the fact and observed that certain items 

       had   been   recovered   at   the   instance   of   A2   and   A4   and 

       they were a haystack, a nylon wire and a plastic wire 

       which   were   not   required   to   commit   the   murder.   We   see 

       that   all   these   items   are   of   common   use   and   have   not 

       been connected with the incident.  The learned counsel

       for   the   appellant   has,   however,   argued   that   the 

       evidence of P.W. 3 would show that accused A2 to A5 had 

       also been seen with the deceased and A1 moving around 

       together.   We have carefully perused the statement of 

       this witness and find  a serious flaw therein inasmuch 

       that   in   his   statement   recorded   under   
Section   161
 

       Cr.P.C. this fact had not been mentioned by him and on 

       the   contrary   the   evidence   suggests   that   all   the   five 

       accused   and   the   deceased   had   been   seen   together   two 

       days   earlier   to   the   incident.     The   High   Court   was, 

       therefore, to our mind, justified in holding that the 

       time lag made it difficult to connect A2 to A5 with the 

       incident.   We also put to the learned counsel for the 

       appellant if there was any other evidence with respect 

       to   the   involvement   of   the   accused.     She   candidly 

       admitted that there was none.



       5.       We   thus   find   no   merit   in   these   appeals   which 

       are, accordingly, dismissed.
