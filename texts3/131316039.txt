              CIVIL  APPELLATE JURISDICTION 



         CIVIL APPEAL NOS.2074-2078  OF  2011
      (Arising out of SLP(C) Nos.26451-26455/2010)


PERSN MEDICINAL PLANTS PVT. LTD. & ANR.     Appellant(s)

                     :VERSUS:

INDIAN BANK AND ORS.                          Respondent(s)





                        O R D E R



      Leave granted.



      We   have   heard   the   learned   counsel   for   the 

parties. 



      These   appeals   emanate   from   the   judgment   and 

orders dated 16th June, 2010 passed by the High Court 

of   Judicature   at   Madras   in   Writ   Petition 

No.17016/2009 and Civil Revision No.2467 of 2009 and 

M.P. Nos.1 & 2 of 2009 in Civil Revision No.2467 of 

2009  by which, while allowing the writ petition and 

the civil revision petition, the High Court has  set 

aside   the   order   passed   by   the   Debts   Recovery 

Appellate Tribunal ("DRAT"). 





                               2


       Our attention has been drawn to a letter dated 

13.12.2010   sent   by   the   Chief   Manager,   Indian   Bank, 

to   the   Director   of   the   appellant   Company,   the 

relevant portion of which reads as under:





       "As   regards   the   liabilities,   we   wish   to 

       state   that   the   amount   due   as   on 

       30.11.2010   is   Rs.3467.89   Lakhs   after 

       appropriation of a sum of Rs.410.00 lakhs 

       collected   after   filing   of   suit   and 

       Rs.5525.00   lakhs   being   the   sale   proceeds 

       of property said above."       (Page 226)



       Learned Solicitor General submits that if the 

Bank is allowed to appropriate this amount, then he 

has   no   objection   to   the   appeal   of   the   appellant 

being   heard   on   merit   by   the   DRAT.     We   direct   that 

the  Indian   Bank  would   be  at   liberty  to   appropriate 

the amount which is already with the Bank, however, 

this would be subject to the final decision of the 

appeal by the DRAT.





       In   the   facts   and   circumstances   of   this   case, 

we direct the DRAT to hear and dispose of the appeal 



                             3



on   all   questions   of   law,   as   expeditiously   as 

possible,  in   any  event,   within  two   months  from   the 

date of the communication of this order.     





       These   appeals   are   accordingly   disposed   of, 

leaving   the   parties   to   bear   their   own   respective 

costs.
