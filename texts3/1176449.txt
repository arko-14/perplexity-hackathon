Ashok Tshering Bhutia                                              ...Appellant


                                     Versus


State of Sikkim                                                    ...Respondent





                               J U D G M E N T



Dr. B.S. CHAUHAN, J.



1.     This appeal has been preferred against the judgment and order 


dated 11.12.2002 passed by the High Court of Sikkim at Gangtok in 


Criminal   Appeal   No.   4   of   2002,   upholding   the   judgment   and   order 


dated   30.5.2002,   passed   by   the   Special   Judge,   Prevention   of 


Corruption Act, Gangtok in Criminal Case No. 4 of 1997, convicting 


the   appellant   for   the   offences   punishable   under   Section   13(2)   read 


with   
Section   13(1)(e)
     of   the   Prevention   of   Corruption   Act,   1988 


(hereinafter called as 
PC Act
 1988) and awarding him the sentence of 


3 years RI and a fine of Rs.10,000/-, in default thereof, to undergo a 


further RI for six months. 



2.      Facts and circumstances giving rise to appeal are as under:



(A)     The appellant joined the Special Branch of   Police in the State 


of Sikkim as a Constable in 1972. He was accorded promotion to the 


rank of Head Constable in 1976, and was subsequently promoted on 


an   ad   hoc   basis   to   the   post   of  Inspector   in   1987.   His   services   were 


attached   to   the   Hon'ble   Chief   Minister   of   Sikkim   in   1987.     The 


appellant   was   repatriated   to   his   parent   department,   i.e.   the   Reserve 


Line, in 1994.






(B)     An FIR dated 5.1.1996 was registered against the appellant by 


the DSP, CBI (ACB) under 
Section 13(2)
 r/w 
Section 13(1)(e)
 of the 


PC   Act   1988,     alleging   that   the   appellant   was   in   possession   of 


disproportionate   assets     to   the   tune   of   Rs.6,46,805/-   and   had 


accumulated the same between 1987 to 1995.




(C)     The   appellant   received   the   office   memorandum   dated   5th/31st 


August, 1996 from the Superintendent of Police, Police Headquarters, 


Gangtok,   directing   him   to   give   a   consolidated   statement   of   the 






                                                                                        2



immovable  properties  inherited and/or owned or acquired  by him in 


his   name   or   in   the   name   of   any   member   of   his   family   during   the 


period   from   1987   to   1995,   as   per   the   requirements   of   statutory 


provisions in the Sikkim Government Servants Conduct Rules, 1981 


(hereinafter called Rules 1981). 






(D)     The   appellant   submitted   the   required   information   vide 


document Ext. D-4 on 10.9.1996 giving full details of the properties 


acquired   and   possessed   by   him.   The   Director   General   of   Police, 


Sikkim granted sanction  on 5.4.1997, under the provisions of 
Section 


19(1)(c)
 of the PC Act 1988 to prosecute the appellant under 
Section 


13(2)
 r/w 
Section 13(1)(e)
 of the PC Act 1988.




(E)     The   charge   sheet   was   submitted   against   the   appellant   on 


23.4.1997, alleging that he was found in possession of the assets dis-



proportionate   to   his   known   sources   of   income,   to   the   tune   of 


Rs.18,25,098.69, which had been acquired by him, abusing his official 


post during the period from 1.4.1987 to 10.1.1996.



(F)     The learned Special Judge vide order dated 18.6.1998 came to 


the conclusion that there was a prima facie case against the appellant 


to try him for the aforesaid charges. 



                                                                                    3


(G)        Being   aggrieved,   the  appellant   approached   the  High   Court  by 


filing   the   Revision   Petition   No.4   of   1998   challenging   the   aforesaid 


order.  The High Court  disposed of the said petition vide order dated 


26.8.1998   holding   that   it   would   be   the   duty   of   the   Investigating 


Officer to establish its authority at the time of commencement of the 


trial. 



(H)        During   the   course   of   trial,   the   prosecution   examined   26 


witnesses   and   the   statement   of   the   appellant   was   recorded   under 



Section   313
   of   the     Code   of   Criminal   Procedure,   1973   (hereinafter 


called  
Cr.P.C
.) on 29.11.2001. Subsequent  thereto,  in support of his 


case the appellant also examined 4 witnesses. The Special Judge held 


the appellant guilty of the aforesaid charges vide judgment and order 


dated 30.5.2002 and awarded the punishment mentioned hereinabove. 



(I)        Being   aggrieved,   the  appellant   approached   the  High   Court  by 


filing   Criminal   Appeal   No.4   of   2002.   During   the   hearing   of   the 


appeal, an argument was advanced before the High Court that a large 


number of documents, particularly the Exhibits P/16, P/17, P/23, P/33, 


P/34, P/35(I), P/35(II), P/35(III), P/62 and P/63, though relied by the 


Special   Judge   during   the   trial,   had   not   been   proved   in   evidence. 



                                                                                 4


Therefore,   the   judgment   of   the   Special   Court   suffered   from 


fundamental   procedural   errors   and   stood   vitiated.     The   High   Court 


instead   of   deciding   the   appeal   taking   into   account   the   aforesaid 


argument,  remitted the matter to the Trial Court vide order dated 27th 


September,   2002,   giving   an   opportunity   to   the   prosecution   to   prove 


those documents and it directed the Trial Court to send the file back to 


the High Court after completing that formality. 



(J)    The   Special   Judge   considered   the   matter   in   the   light   of   the 


directions issued by the High Court and on an application submitted 


by the Special Public Prosecutor on 7.10.2002, issued summons to 12 


witnesses i.e. Shri Kishore Kumar Mukhiya (PW.3), Shri P.S. Rasaily 


(PW.4),   Shri   Chandra   Prakash   Raya   (PW.6),   Shri   B.K   Gurung 


(PW.8), Shri B.K. Mukhiya (PW.9), Shri Kamal Tewari (PW.10), Shri 


R.K. Gupta (PW.11), Shri K. Somarajan (PW.12), Shri D.P. Deokotta 


(PW.15), Shri C.K. Das (PW.16), Shri Shri B.K. Trihatri (PW.23) and 


Shri   Pallav   Kenowar   (PW.24)   to   appear   before   it   to   prove   the 


aforesaid   documents,   and   dates   were   fixed   for   that   purpose   from 


25.10.2002 to 30.10.2002.



                                                                                  5


(K)    In   spite   of   all   this,   the   prosecution   failed   to   prove   the   said 


documents as the original records of the aforesaid documents, which 


related   to   the   bills   of   telephone   and   electricity   expenditure 


aggregating   to Rs.1,04,364/-. Shri   R.K.  Gupta,  Sr. Accounts   Officer 


(PW.11)   appeared   before   the   Special   Court   and   admitted   that   the 


original S.R.C. could not be produced in the court as the same was not 


traceable in respect of the telephone bill. Same remained the position 


in respect of the electricity charges as Shri D.P. Deokota, Executive 


Engineer,   Power   Department   (PW.15),   admitted   that   the   original 


demand register could not be brought as the same was not traceable. 



With the aforesaid remarks, the Special Judge referred the matter back 


to   the   High   Court   and   the   High   Court   heard   the   arguments   and 


dismissed the appeal vide impugned judgment and order. Hence, this 


appeal. 



3.     Shri   V.A.   Bobde,   learned   senior   counsel   appearing   for   the 


appellant,   has   raised   a   large   number   of   issues   contending  inter-alia 


that   the   FIR  could   not   have   been   lodged   without   the   written 


order/direction   of   the   Superintendent   of   Police.   The   FIR   had   been 


lodged in flagrant violation of statutory requirements. The question of 


putting the criminal law into motion could not arise.  Executive action 





                                                                                       6



has   not   only   been   taken   irresponsibly,   it   tantamounts   to   abuse   of 


power. The courts below not only ought to have disapproved of it but 


should have refused to act upon it.   The police authorities cannot be 


permitted to take advantage of an abuse of power.   Sanction could not 


have   been   accorded   without   considering   the   contents   of   Ex.D-4;   no 


preliminary   enquiry   had   been   conducted   against   the   appellant,   as 


required   by   various   judicial   pronouncements   of   this   Court.   The 


documents very heavily relied upon by the prosecution had never been 


proved in spite of remand of the case for that purpose. Remand even 


for limited purpose to prove the documents was impermissible as it is 


tantamount to giving an opportunity to the prosecution to fill up any 


lacunae in its case. The procedural error committed by the prosecution 


is   not   curable.   Therefore,   the   entire   prosecution   proceedings   stood 


vitiated.   More  so,  the  evidence  adduced  by  the appellant  in defence 


regarding the income from his rented premises had been discarded on 


flimsy grounds e.g. that the tenants had not shown their income and 


expenditure   while   filling   up   the   income   tax   returns,   nor   had   the 


tenants produced the rent receipts or on the basis that there was some 


discrepancy   between   the   income   derived     from   the   tenants   and   the 


amounts shown from other sources while submitting the Ext. D-4.  



                                                                                 7


        Shri Bobde has further submitted that the Explanation added to 



Section   13(1)(e)
   of   PC   Act   1988   did   not   exist   in   the   
Prevention   of 


Corruption   Act,   1947
   (hereinafter   called   Act   1947).   It   provides   that 


"known sources of income" means income received from any lawful 


source and such receipts had been submitted by the appellant in Ext. 



D-4. No such requirement was there under 
Section 5(1)(e)
 of the Act, 


1947   and,   therefore,   the   start   of   check   period   from   1.4.1987   and 


computation   of   income   was   not   based   on   any   income   derived   from 


other   lawful   sources.   The   addition   of   the   Explanation   to   
Section 


13(1)(e)
   led   to   a   material   change   in   the   statutory   requirement.   The 


courts below failed to appreciate the submission that the 
PC Act
 1988 


was made applicable in the State of Sikkim on 12.9.1988, though in 


other States it had come into force earlier.   The prosecution failed to 


make any segregation between the periods covered by the two Acts, as 


regards   income,   expenditure,   savings,   assets   with   the   result   that 


prosecution   had   not   proved   any   of   the   said   documents   from 


12.9.1988. Thus, the entire proceedings had been conducted in gross 


violation   of   the   rights   of   the   appellant   under   
Article   21
   of   the 


Constitution of India. In view of the above, the appeal deserves to be 






                                                                                      8



allowed and judgments and orders of the courts below are liable to be 


set aside.



4.      On   the   contrary,   Shri   P.P.   Malhotra,   Additional   Solicitor 


General and Shri A. Mariarputham, learned senior counsel appearing 


for the respondents, have vehemently opposed the appeal pointing out 


that   the   document   Ext.D-4   was   not   submitted   in   compliance   of   the 


statutory   requirement   of   
Section   19
   of   Rules   1981.   The   fact   that 


documents   particularly   the   telephone   and   electricity   bills   were   not 


proved even after remand itself does not affect the merits of the case, 


as the same cannot be a ground for disbelieving the said documents. 



The said bills had been prepared on the basis of the registers, though 


registers could not be traced and the bills could not be proved. 



        Addition of Explanation to 
Section 13(1)(e)
 of the PC Act 1988 


does not make any difference whatsoever in view of the fact that once 


the   prosecution   successfully   establishes   the   possession   of   dis-



proportionate   assets   the   burden   shifts   to   the   accused     to   prove   his 


innocence. Mere acquisition of property does not itself constitute an 


offence under the 
P.C. Act, 1988
, rather it is failure to satisfactorily 


account   for   such   possession   of   property   that   makes   the   possession 






                                                                                    9



thereof objectionable as offending the law.   The issue of segregation 


of   income   and   expenditure   etc.   for   the   periods   covered   by   the   two 


Acts is not required to be considered as 
PC Act
 1947 as well as 
PC 


Act
 1988 provided for the possession of assets at any time during the 


period of his office.   Defence evidence has rightly been discarded by 


the courts below being not reliable. Any error, omission or irregularity 


in the sanction does not vitiate the trial unless a failure of justice has 


been occasioned thereby. Thus, the appeal is devoid of any merit and 


is liable to the dismissed. 



5.           We   have   considered   the   rival   submissions   made   by   learned 


counsel for the parties and perused the record. 



6.     This Court in P. Sirajuddin etc. v. The State of Madras etc., 


AIR 1971 SC 520; and 
State of Haryana & Ors.  v. Ch. Bhajan Lal 


& Ors.
, AIR 1992 SC 604 has categorically held that before a public 


servant is charged with an act of dishonesty  which amounts to serious 


mis-demeanor and an FIR is lodged against him, there must be some 


suitable   preliminary   enquiry   into   the   allegations   by   a   responsible 


officer. Such a course has not been adopted by the prosecution though 






                                                                                   10



the law declared by this Court is binding on everyone in view of the 


provisions of 
Article 14
 of the Constitution, which would by all means 


override   the   statutory   provisions   of   the   
Cr.P.C
.   and   such   an 


irregularity is not curable nor does it fall within the ambit of 
Section 


465
  Cr.P.C.   However,  as  the issue  is  being raised  first  time  before 


this Court, it is not worth further consideration. More so, the aforesaid 


observations do not lay down law of universal application.




7.      Much has been argued on the issue that investigation has been 


conducted   without   a   proper   order   in   writing,   by   an   officer   not 


authorised otherwise and sanction has been granted under 
Section 19
 


of   the   PC   Act   1988   vide   order   dated   5.4.1997,   without   taking   into 


account     the   assets   and   income  shown   in   Ext.   D-4,   though   the   said 


assets   represented   known   sources   of   income   within   the   meaning   of 



Section 13(1)(e)
 and the Explanation attached thereto.   It has further 


been submitted that an invalid sanction cannot be the foundation for 


the   prosecution   and   thus,   the   entire   investigation   and   trial   stood 


vitiated as the investigation without proper authorisation  and invalid 


sanction   goes   to   the   root   of   the   jurisdiction   of   the   court   and   so   the 


conviction cannot stand.



                                                                                           11


8.      The   issues   raised   hereinabove   are   no   more  res   integra.   The 


matter   of investigation by an officer not authorised by law has been 


considered by this Court time and again and it has consistently been 


held  that a defect or irregularity in investigation however serious, has 


no   direct   bearing   on   the   competence   or   procedure   relating   to 


cognizance  or  trial  and,  therefore,  where  the   cognizance  of  the  case 


has in fact been taken and the case has proceeded to termination, the 


invalidity   of   the   precedent   investigation   does   not   vitiate   the   result, 


unless a miscarriage of justice has been caused thereby. The defect or 


irregularity in investigation has no bearing on the competence of the 


Court   or   procedure   relating   to   cognizance   or   trial.   (Vide  H.N. 


Rishbud & Anr.  v. State of  Delhi, AIR 1955 SC 196; Munnalal v. 



State of U.P., AIR 1964 SC 28,  Khandu Sonu Dhobi & Anr. v. The

9.      In Kalpnath Rai v. State (Through CBI), AIR 1998 SC 201,  a 


case   under   the   provisions   of   
Section   20
   of   Terrorist   and   Disruptive 






                                                                                    12



Activities (Prevention) Act, 1987, this Court considered the issue as to 


whether an oral direction to an officer to conduct investigation could 


meet   the   requirement   of   law.   After   considering   the   statutory 


provisions,   the   Court   came   to   the   conclusion   that   as  oral   approval 


was obtained from the competent officer concerned, it was sufficient 


to legalise the further action. 



10.     
In  
State   Inspector   of   Police,   Vishakhapatnam   v.   Surya 


Sankaram   Karri
,   (2006)   7   SCC   172,   a   two-Judge   Bench     of   this 


Court     had   taken   a   contrary   view   without   taking   note   of   the   earlier 


two-Judge   Bench   judgment   in  Kalpnath   Rai  (supra)   and   held   as 


under:




                    "When   a   statutory   functionary   passes   an  

            order, that too authorizing a person to carry out a  

            public   function   like   investigation   into   an   offence,  

            an order in writing was required to be passed. A  

            statutory   functionary   must   act   in   a   manner   laid  

            down in the statute. Issuance of an oral direction  

            is not contemplated under the Act. Such a concept  

            is   unknown   in   administrative   law.   The   statutory  

            functionaries   are   enjoyed   with   a   duty   to   pass  

            written orders. However, the Court taking note of  

            subsequent   proceedings   recorded   its   conclusions  

            as under: 





                    `It   is   true   that   only   on   the   basis   of   illegal  

            investigation   a   proceeding   may   not   be   quashed  

            unless miscarriage of justice is shown, but in this  





                                                                                         13



            case   as   we   have   noticed   hereinbefore,   the  

            respondent had suffered miscarriage of justice as  

            the investigation made by PW 41 was not fair'."  





11.     In the instant case, the officer has mentioned in the FIR itself 


that   he   had   orally   been   directed   by   the   Superintendent   of   Police   to 


investigate the case.  It is evident from the above that the judgments in 


Kalpnath   Rai  (supra)   and  
Surya   Sankaram   Karri
    (supra)   have 


been   decided   by   two   Judge   Benches   of   this   Court   and   in   the   latter 


judgment, the earlier judgment of this Court in Kalpnath Rai (supra) 


has not been taken note of.  Technically speaking it can be held to be 


per  incuriam.   There  is  nothing on  record  to show  that  the officer's 


statement is not factually correct.   We have no occasion to decide as 


which of the earlier judgments is binding.  It is evident that there was 


a direction by the Superintendent of Police to the officer concerned to 


investigate the case.  Thus, in the facts and circumstances of the case, 


the issue as to whether the oral order could meet the requirement of 


law remains merely a technical issue. Further, as there is nothing on 


record to show that the investigation had been conducted unfairly, we 


are not inclined to examine the issue further.




                                                                                     14


12.     Same remained the position regarding sanction. In the absence 


of   anything   to   show   that   any   defect   or   irregularity   therein   caused   a 


failure of justice, the plea is without substance. A failure of justice is 


relatable to error, omission or irregularity in the sanction. Therefore, a 


mere error, omission or irregularity in sanction is not considered to be 


fatal   unless   it   has   resulted   in   a   failure   of   justice   or   has   been 


occasioned thereby. 
Section 19 (1)
 of the PC Act 1988 is a matter of 


procedure and does not go to the root of the jurisdiction  and once the 


cognizance has been taken by the Court under 
Cr.P.C
.,   it cannot be 


said  that an invalid  police report  is  the foundation of jurisdiction  of 


the  court  to  take  cognizance.   (Vide  Kalpnath  Rai  (supra);  
State  of 


Orissa   v.   Mrutunjaya   Panda
,   AIR   1998   SC   715;

Inspector   v.  Sri   T.   Venkatesh   Murthy
,  (2004)   7   SCC   763;

2007   SC   1274;   and  M.C.   Mehta  v.  Union   of   India   &   Ors.   (Taj 


Corridor Scam),  AIR 2007 SC 1087).




13.     
In 
State of Haryana & Ors.  v. Ch. Bhajan Lal & Ors.
, AIR 


1992 SC 604, this Court dealing with the same provisions held that a 






                                                                                      15



conjoint reading of the main provision, Section 5-A(1) (new Section


17) and the two provisos thereto, shows that the investigation by the 


designated   police   officer   was   the   rule   and   the   investigation   by   an 


officer   of   a   lower   rank   was   an   exception.   It   has   been   ruled   by   the 


Court  in several  decisions   that Section   6-A  (new 
Section   23
)  of  the 


Act was mandatory and not directory and the investigation conducted 


in   violation   thereof   bears   the   stamp   of   illegality,   but   that   illegality 


committed   in   the   course   of   an   investigation,   does   not   affect   the 


competence and the jurisdiction  of the Court for trial and where the 


cognizance   of   the   case   has   in   fact   been   taken   and   the   case   has 


proceeded   to   termination,   the   validity   of   the   proceedings   is   not 


vitiated unless a miscarriage of justice  has been caused as a result of 


the illegality in the investigation.  



 
In   the   facts   and   circumstances   of   the   case,   we   are   also   not 


willing to examine the correctness of submissions made by Mr. Bobde 


in   respect   of   segregation   of   period   covered   by   two   Acts   and   as   to 


whether ratio of the judgment of this Court in 
State of Maharashtra 


v. Krishnarao Dudhappa Shinde
, (2009) 4 SCC 219, runs counter to 


the   ratio   in  
State   of   Maharashtra   v.   Kaliar   Koil   Subramaniam 


Ramaswamy
,  AIR   1977   SC   2091,   wherein   the   earlier   judgment   in 






                                                                                        16


Sajjan   Singh   v.   State   of   Punjab
,  AIR   1964   SC   464,   had   been 


explained.




14.     In view of the above, the facts and circumstances of the instant 


case require an examination of the case on merits. 



Additional Evidence:



15.     Additional evidence at appellate stage is permissible, in case of 


a failure of justice. However, such power must be exercised sparingly 


and only in exceptional suitable cases where the court is satisfied that 


directing   additional   evidence   would   serve   the   interests   of   justice.   It 


would depend upon the facts and circumstances of an individual case 


as to whether such  permission should be granted having due regard to 


the concepts of fair play, justice and the well-being of society. Such 


an   application   for   taking   additional   evidence   must   be   decided 


objectively,   just   to   cure   the   irregularity.   The   primary   object   of   the 


provisions of 
Section 391
 Cr.P.C. is the prevention of a guilty man's 


escape   through   some   careless   or   ignorant   action   on   part   of   the 


prosecution before the court or for vindication of an innocent person 


wrongfully   accused,     where   the   court   omitted   to   record   the 


circumstances essential to elucidation of truth. Generally, it should be 





                                                                                     17



invoked   when   formal   proof   for   the   prosecution   is   necessary.     (Vide

1965   SC   1887;  Ratilal   Bhanji   Mithani   v.   The   State   of 


Maharashtra   &   Ors.,   AIR   1971   SC   1630;  Rambhau   &   Anr.   v.

16.    This Court in 
State of Gujarat v. Mohanlal Jitamalji Porwal 


& Anr.
, AIR 1987 SC 1321, dealing with the issue held as under:




       "...To deny the opportunity to remove the formal  

       defect   was   to   abort   a   case   against   an   alleged  

       economic   offender.   Ends   of   justice   are   not  

       satisfied only when the accused in a criminal case  

       is   acquitted.   The  community   acting   through   the  

       State and the Public Prosecutor is also entitled to  

       justice. The cause of the community deserves equal  

       treatment   at   the   hands   of   the   court   in   the  

       discharge of its judicial functions. The community  

       or   the   State   is   not   a   persona-non-grata   whose  

       cause   may   be   treated   with   disdain.   The   entire  

       community is aggrieved if the economic offenders  

       who ruin the economy of the State are not brought  

       to book. A murder may be committed in the heat of  

       moment   upon   passions   being   aroused.   An  





                                                                                 18



       economic   offence   is   committed   with   cool  

       calculation   and   deliberate   design   with   an   eye   on  

       personal   profit   regardless   of   the   consequence   to  

       the community. A disregard for the interest of the  

       community   can   be   manifested   only   at   the   cost   of  

       forfeiting   the   trust   and   faith   of   the   community   in  

       the system to administer justice in an even-handed  

       manner without fear of criticism from the quarters  

       which view white collar crimes with a permissive  

       eye unmindful of the damage done to the national  

       economy and national interest....." 





17.    In  Rambhau  (supra),  a   larger   Bench   of   this   Court   held   as 


under: 



       "Incidentally,   Section   391   forms   an   exception   to  

       the general rule that an Appeal must be decided on  

       the evidence which was before the Trial Court and  

       the  powers being an exception shall always have  

       to be exercised with caution and circumspection  

       so   as   to   meet   the   ends   of   justice.  Be   it   noted  

       further   that   the   doctrine   of   finality   of   judicial  

       proceedings does not stand annulled or affected in  

       any   way   by   reason   of   exercise   of   power   under  

       Section 391 since the same avoids a de novo trial.  

       It is not to fill up the lacuna but to subserve the  

       ends   of   justice.  Needless   to   record   that   on   an  

       analysis of the Civil Procedure Code, Section 391  

       is   thus  akin   to   Order   41,   Rule   27   of   the   C.P.  

       Code."  (Emphasis added)





18.    In view of the above, the law on the point can be summarised to 


the effect that additional evidence can be taken at the appellate stage 


in   exceptional   circumstances,   to   remove   an   irregularity,   where   the 






                                                                               19



circumstances so warrant in public interest.  Generally, such power is 


exercised to have formal proof of the documents etc. just to meet the 


ends   of   justice.   However,   the   provisions   of   Section   391   Cr.P.C. 



cannot   be   pressed   into   service   in   order   to   fill   up   lacunae   in   the 


prosecution's case.



19.     
In  
Santa  Singh  v.  State   of  Punjab
,  AIR  1956  SC   526;  
Tori 


Singh   &   Anr.   v.   State   of   Uttar   Pradesh
,   AIR   1962   SC   399;   and 



State   of  Rajasthan   v.    Bhawani   &  Anr.
,   AIR   2003   SC   4230,  this 


Court   
placed   reliance   upon
   its   earlier   judgment   and   came   to   the 


conclusion   that   any   information   or   statement   made   before   the 


investigating officer under 
Section 161
 Cr.P.C. requires corroboration 


by sufficient evidence.
 In the absence of any corroboration thereof,  it 


would merely be a case where some witnesses had stated a particular 


fact   before   the   investigating   officer   and   the   same   remained 


inadmissible in law, in view of the provisions of Section 162 Cr.P.C. 



20.     In the instant case, the electricity and telephone bills have not 


been   proved   at   the   time   of   trial.   The   High   Court   while   hearing   the 


appeal   remitted   the   matter   back   to   the   Trial   Court   to   allow   the 






                                                                                      20



prosecution   to   prove   the   said   documents   and   in   spite   of   giving   full 


opportunity   to   the   prosecution   witnesses,   the   said   bills   were   not 


proved.   Though   it   may   be   permissible   in   law   as   referred   to 


hereinabove to get the formal approval of the documents by adducing 


additional   evidence,   but   it   cannot   be   held   even   by   any   stretch   of 


imagination that in absence of proving the said documents the same 


can   be   relied   upon.   Therefore,   the   judgments   of   the   courts   below 


suffered from a fundamental procedural error and the amount shown 


in   the   said   bills   to   the   tune   of   Rs.1,04,364/-   cannot   be   taken   into 


account.  



21.     For   the  sake   of argument,   even  if   it  is  assumed  that  the  form 


required   to   be   filled   up   under   Rule   19   of   the   Rules   1981   was 


mandatory and the appellant failed to fill up the same, for the reason 


that the form had never been prescribed under the Rules 1981, and he 


ought   to   have   declared   the   same   on   plain   papers,   as   he   did   on 


instructions of the superior authority after lodging of the FIR against 


him,   the   document   Ext.D-4   could   not   be   rejected   merely   on   the 


ground  that  it  had  been  submitted   after  the  lodging  of the   FIR.  Not 


filling up the form under the mandatory requirement of   Rule 19 of 






                                                                                       21



Rules   1981   may   render   the   appellant   liable   for   disciplinary 


proceedings   under   service   jurisprudence,   but   that   itself   cannot   be   a 


ground for rejection of the said documents in toto without examining 


the contents thereof. In this regard, we are of the considered view that 


the   courts   below   have   committed   a   grave   error   and   the   contents 


thereof should have been examined.  



22.    
In  
Bharat   Sanchar   Nigam   Limited   &   Anr.   v.   BPL   Mobile 


Cellular   Limited   &  Ors.
,  (2008) 13  SCC  597,  this  Court  held that 


"prescribed"   means   that   prescribed   in   accordance   with   law   and  not 


otherwise.




       Thus, in view of the above, furnishing information about assets 


and income etc. on a plain paper was not required as the Government 


failed to prescribe the said form.



23.    It has been urged by the respondents that the contents of Ext.D-



4 were rightly rejected as evidence by the High Court for two reasons; 



(i)       Ext.D-4 is not in compliance with the Rules 1981; and (ii) the 


statements   of   the   defence   witnesses   corroborating   the   contents   of 


Ext.D-4 must be discarded because they did not account for rent paid 






                                                                                  22



in their IT returns or show any receipts or any documents to support 


their statements. 



24.    The relevant portion of Rule 19(i)(a) of the Rules 1981 reads as 


under: 



       "19(i) a   government   servant   shall,   on   his   first  

       appointment to any service or post and thereafter  

       at the close of every financial year, submit to the  

       government   return   of   his   assets   and   liabilities  in  

       such   form   as   may   be   prescribed   by   the  

       Government giving full particulars....." 


                                                                    (Emphasis added)





25.    The contention of the respondents regarding non compliance of 


the Rules 1981 adversely affecting the evidentiary value of   Ext.D-4 


must be rejected for at least two reasons; 



       (i)     The   Rules   1981   are   not   rules   of   evidence.   The 


               admissibility   and   probative   value   of   evidence   is 


               determined   under   the   provisions   of   the   
Indian 


               Evidence   Act,   1872
.   These   rules   are   merely 


               service   rules   by   which   government   servants   in 


               Sikkim   are   expected   to   abide.   Consequently,   the 


               respondent has not been able to provide any cogent 


               reason   why   the   contents   of   Ext.D-4   should   be 


               disregarded; and






                                                                                        23


         (ii)     Rule 19(i)(a) of the Rules 1981 does undoubtedly 


                  require   government   servants   to   on   first 


                  appointment to any service or post and thereafter at 


                  the   close   of   every   financial   year   submit   to   the 


                  government the return of their assets and liabilities. 



                  However,   it   is   to   be   noted   that   the   said   rule 


                  envisages   that   public   servants   will   submit   such 


                  returns   in   a  prescribed   form.   Despite   being 


                  repeatedly   questioned   by   this   Court,   the 


                  respondents   were   unable   to   produce   such   form. 



                  Thus,   it   cannot   be   said   that   the   appellant   did   not 


                  comply with the said rule as in the absence of such 


                  a form it was impossible for him to have done so 


                  (through no fault of his own). In any event, failing 


                  to   submit   such   returns   even   if   there   had   been   no 


                  such   a   form,   would   make   the   appellant   liable   to 


                  face the disciplinary proceedings under the service 


                  rules   applicable   at   the   relevant   time.     The 


                  provisions of the Rules 1981 cannot by any stretch 


                  of   imagination   be   said   to   have   the   effect   of 


                  rendering   evidence   inadmissible   in   criminal 


                  proceedings under the 
PC Act
 1988.  



                      Thus,   in   such   a   fact   situation,   the   appellant   could   not   be 


fastened   with   criminal   liability   for   want   of   compliance   of   the   said 


requirement of the Rules. 



                                                                                               24


26.    Learned senior counsel appearing for the respondent has placed 


a   great   deal   of   emphasis   on   the   argument   that   Mohanlal   Goyal, 


D.W.1,   Nagaram   Agrawal,   D.W.2,   Thakur   Bansari,   D.W.3   and   Dil 


Hassasan Ansari, D.W.4, did not show that they had taken the shops 


from the appellant on rent as they did not disclose the said fact in their 


respective income tax returns nor did they produce sales tax returns or 


rent receipts. There can be no doubt that the fact that DWs 1-4 did not 


show the transactions in their IT returns reduces their credibility in the 


eyes of the Court, but that does not have any impact on the contents of 


Ext. D-4 itself.



27.    Thus, it becomes clear that the High Court erred in not placing 


reliance   on   the   evidence   contained   in   Ext.   D-4.   Taking   into 


consideration   the   contents   of   Ext.   D-4,   it   becomes   clear   that   the 


alleged unexplained income of the Appellant is only Rs. 2,71,613.64. 



This   unexplained   income   is   significantly   lower   than   what   had   been 


alleged by the prosecution. It must also be borne in mind that check 


period had been very long and consequently, it is easily possible that a 


small   over-estimation   of   the   Respondent's   expenditure   would   have 


been multiplied and could easily explain the said amount.   Thus, the 






                                                                                 25



    submission   made   on   behalf   of   the   appellant   that   there   has   been   an 


    over-estimation of  his expenses, further telephone bills and electricity 


    bills aggregating to Rs.1,04,364.00 have not been proved before the 


    Trial Court and even after remand by the High Court when witnesses 


    were   recalled,   if   accepted   would   mean   that   the   alleged   unexplained 


    income is further reduced to Rs.1,67,249.64.   



    28.     No   doubt   the   prosecution   has   to   establish   that   the   pecuniary 


    assets acquired by the public servant are disproportionately larger than 


    his known sources of income and then it is for the public servant to 


    account for such excess. The offence becomes complete on the failure 


    of the public servant to account or explain such excess. 



    29.     The High Court has found that the appellant was in possession 


    of   assets   amounting   to   Rs.18,25,098.69     for   which   he   could   not 


    account.   In   coming   to   this   conclusion,   the   High   Court   made   the 


    following calculations:



Known   income   of   appellant   and                    Rs.14,54,629.81

his wife during the check period


Expenditure   of   the   appellant   and                 Rs.12, 75,928.05





                                                                                       26



his wife during the check period

Actual   assets   in   possession   of   the               Rs.20,38,715.45

the check period

wife at the end of the check period                        Rs.12, 75,928.05

                                                         = Rs. 1,78,701.76

his   wife   at   the   beginning   of   the

                                                           = Rs.18,25,098.69

                                                       





     30.     The High Court has held that the appellant has amassed assets 


     disproportionate   to   his   known   sources   of   income.   However, 


     throughout the investigation, trial and appeal, the income contained in 


     Ex.D-4 has been totally ignored in computing the income from known 


     sources   as   being   Rs.14,54,629.81.   B.K.   Roka,   PW.19,   the 


     Superintendent of Police has admitted that even before sanction was 


     granted on 5.4.1997, the accused had complied with Rule 19 and that 


     Ex.D-4,   subject   to   mathematical   accuracy,   for   the   years   1987-1994 


     would aggregate to Rs.15,88,400/- according to the break-up of each 


     financial   year.   Similarly,   Chand   Prakash   Raya,   P.W.6   stated   that 


     through   Ex.D-4   the   accused   had   complied   with   Rule   19.   Therefore, 






                                                                                   27



     this   figure   should   have   been   added   to   income   from   known   sources 


     which   would   have   then   amounted   to   Rs.30,43,029.81.   Even   if   the 


     expenditure is taken to be Rs.12,75,928.05, the likely savings amount 


     is Rs.17,67,101.76 and not Rs.1,78,701.76. Thus, the gap between the 


     assets   worth   Rs.20,38,715.45   and   the   savings   of   Rs.17,67,10176 


     would be Rs.2,71,613.69 instead of Rs.18,25,098.69. Thus, the table 


     above should have read as follows: 





Known   income   of   appellant   and                         Rs.14,54,629.81 (+)

his   wife   during   the   check   period            Rs.15,88,400.00

                                                                                                   28




        Thus, it is evident from the above table that only a sum of Rs. 


2.71 lacs (approx.) remains unexplained.


 



31.     
In  
State of Maharashtra v. Pollonji Darabshaw Daruwalla
, 


AIR 1988 SC 88, this Court held as under:


        "....on   a   consideration   of   the   matter   it   cannot   be  

        said   that   there   is   no   disproportion   or   even   a  

        sizeable   disproportion.....There   are   also   other  

        possible errors in the calculations in regard to point  


        (c). The finding becomes inescapable that the assets  

        were in excess of the known sources of income. But  

        on   the   question  whether   the   extent   of   the  

        disproportion is such as to justify a conviction for  

        criminal   misconduct....,   a   somewhat   liberal   view  

        requires to be taken of what proportion of assets in  

        excess   of   the   known   sources   of   income   constitutes  

        "disproportion"   for   purposes   of   
Section   5(1)(e)
   of  

        the Act."                                         (Emphasis added)






32.     In   view   of   the   above,   at   the   most   a   sum   of   Rs.   2,71,613.69 


remained unexplained. The appellant entered into in service in 1972 


and   there   is   no   break   up   so   far   as   assets   and   expenditures   etc.   are 


concerned in the charge sheet though the check period covered both 


the   Acts   i.e.   P.C.   Acts,   1947   or   1988.     Even   if   the   said   amount   is 


spread   over   the   period   from   1987   to   1996,   the   alleged   unexplained 






                                                                                         29



income  remains merely a marginal/paltry sum which any government 


employee can  save every year. 





33.    In   view   of   the   above,   we   are   of   the   considered   opinion   that 


judgments and orders of the courts below cannot be sustained in the 


eyes of law and they are liable to be set aside.  The appeal is allowed. 



The   judgments   and   orders   of   the   courts   below   dated   11.12.2002 


passed by the High Court of Sikkim at Gangtok in   Criminal Appeal 


No. 4 of 2002 and judgment and order dated 30.5.2002 passed by the 


Special   Judge,   Prevention   of   Corruption   Act,   Gangtok   in   Criminal 


Case No. 4 of 1997 are hereby set aside.
