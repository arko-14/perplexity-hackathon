                   CRIMINAL APPELLATE JURISDICTION

                 CRIMINAL APPEAL NO(s). 807 OF 2007


JAGGA SINGH & ANR.                                               Appellant (s)

                                    VERSUS

STATE OF PUNJAB                                                  Respondent(s)


                                O    R    D    E   R

       Heard learned counsel for the parties.

       This     Appeal    has   been          filed    against    the    impugned

judgment of the High Court of Punjab and Haryana dated

04.12.2006.



       The facts have been set out in the impugned judgment

and hence we are not repeating the same here except where

necessary.



       In brief, the prosecution case is that on 24.4.92 at

about 8.30 p.m., the 3 accused came to the house of Raja

Singh.     Later, one of them fired at Baggar Singh on his

right thigh.           Baggar Singh fell down.                 Then the accused

took     away    the     deceased        Hoshiar       Singh   towards    village

Heerawala.        After about 20 minutes the sound of 3 or 4

shots was heard.           Next morning the dead body of Hoshiar

Singh was found.



       The trial Court convicted Jagga Singh to 7 years R.I.

and a fine under 
Section 307
 IPC.                       Jagtar Singh and Kaka

Singh were also sentenced to 7 years R.I. and a fine.                         The

appeals of the accused to the High Court were dismissed,
but the appeal of the State regarding acquittal of the

accused under 
Section 302
 read with 
Section 34
 was allowed,

and they were convicted under 
Section 302
.                              Hence, this

appeal.



      On the facts of the case, we are of the opinion that

the appellants are entitled to get the benefit of doubt so

far   as   offence       under     
Section         302
    Indian    Penal     Code    is

concerned      because       the   prosecution           case   was    that   Hoshiar

Singh was taken away by the accused and after 15/20 minutes

gun shots were heard.              However, the post mortem examination

on the dead body of the deceased found that there were only

lacerated wounds. There was no gun shot wound on the body

of the deceased.                 Hence, some doubt is created in the

prosecution version regarding the charge under 
Section 302


IPC   whose      benefit      will       go   to    the    accused.         Thus     the

appellants are entitled to get the benefit of doubt on that

charge and consequently they are acquitted of charge                            under


Section 302
 IPC.



      However, we are of the opinion that the appellants are

guilty     under       
Section     325
    IPC      read    with    
Section     34
    IPC

because admittedly a gun shot was fired at Baggar Singh

which    hit     him    in   the    leg.      On    that    count      we   award    the

sentence of the period already undergone by the appellants.


      The impugned judgment of the High Court is modified to

the     extent     stated        above.       The    Appeal       is    disposed      of

accordingly.



      On 14.09.2007 this Court had ordered that the sentence
of   imprisonment   imposed   on   the   appellants   shall   remain

suspended during the pendency of the Appeal provided each

of them furnishes personal bond in the sum of Rs. 20,000/-

(Twenty Thousand Only) with two sureties in the sum of

Rs. 10,000/- (Ten Thousand Only) each to the satisfaction

of the trial court. Their bonds are discharged accordingly.
