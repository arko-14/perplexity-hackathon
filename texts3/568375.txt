               IN THE SUPREME COURT OF INDIA

                CIVIL APPELLATE JURISDICTION





                CIVIL APPEAL NO.1891 OF 2011

      (Arising out of SLP (Civil) No.13771 of 2010)





P.S. Somanathan and Ors.                      ...Appellant(s)





                            Versus 





District Insurance Officer and Anr.   ...Respondent(s)





                         J U D G M E N T



GANGULY, J.



1.    Delay condoned.



2.    Leave granted.



3.    One   Suresh   Chandra   Babu,   was   walking   along   the 



      side   of   Alappuzha-Kollam   National   Highway   near 



      Punnapra   junction   on   25.07.1994,   when   a   lorry 






                                1



      (bearing   registration   No.   KL   4/6802)   which   was 



      being driven rashly suddenly hit him. As a result 



      of   which   he   sustained   serious   injuries   and   died 



      on the spot. The lorry which was insured with the 



      first   respondent   was   owned   by   the   second 



      respondent.



4.    The   appellants   (claimants)   who   are   the   family 



      members   of   the   deceased   filed   a   claim   petition 



      before the Motor Accident Claims Tribunal (MACT), 



      claiming   Rs.1,75,000/-   as   compensation.   The   same 



      was         contested         by         the         first         and         second 



      respondents.



5.    Before   the   MACT,   the   following   issues   were 



      framed:



      "i.    Whether the accident was due to the rash and 



             negligent   driving   of   the   second   respondent 



             herein?







      ii.    Whether   the   petitioners   were   entitled   to   get 



             any   compensation   and   if   so,   what   was   the 



             quantum and who all were liable?"






                                          2


6.    Based   on   the   evidence   on   record,   MACT   concluded 



      that   the   accident   had   occurred   in   view   of   the 



      rash   and   negligent   driving   of   the   second 



      respondent and it awarded a total compensation of 



      Rs.1,71,600/-   together   with   interest   at   the   rate 



      of 12% p.a. and cost of Rs.1,500/-. It calculated 



      the same as follows:



      "...Suresh   Chandra   Babu   aged   33   years   died 

      due to injuries sustained in the accident. 

      PW1   swears   that   at   the   time   of   accident 

      Suresh   Chandra   Babu   was   working   as   an 

      operator              in          Motherland                      Industries, 

      Punnapra   and   was   getting   Rs.4,500/-   p.m. 

      In   Ext.   A1   FIR,   it   is   stated   that   Suresh 

      Chandra   Babu   was   working   as   a   mechanic 

      operator   in   Motherland   Industries   Company. 

      PW1   swears   that   Suresh   Chandra   Babu   was 

      unmarried   and   he   was   looking   after   the 

      affairs   of   the   family.   Considering   the 

      nature of the work done by deceased Suresh 

      Chandra   Babu,   his   monthly   income   can   be 

      assessed   as   Rs.1,200/-   for   the   purpose   of 

      calculating                 just            compensation.                 After 

      deducting   his   personal   expenses   he   would 

      be   contributing   Rs.800/-   p.m.   to   his 

      mother-   the   first   petitioner.   In   this 

      manner, the annual dependency of the first 

      petitioner   of   the   deceased   comes   to 

      Rs.9,600/-.   In   this   case   16   can   be 

      determined                  as         suitable                   multiplier. 

      Therefore,   the   amount   of   compensation   on 

      account   of   loss   of   dependency   comes   to 

      Rs.1,53,000/-.   Rs.15,000/-   can   be   awarded 

      towards          compensation                         for         pain         and 




                                                  3



      suffering.   Rs.1,900/-   can   be   awarded 

      towards          transportation         charges         and 

      Rs.2,000/-   can   be   awarded   towards   funeral 

      expenses.   Thus,   in   total,   the   petitioner 

      is   entitled   to   get   Rs.1,71,600/-   as 

      compensation."





7.    The   first   respondent   appealed   against   the 



      judgment   of   the   MACT   before   the   High   Court   of 



      Kerala at Ernakulam.



8.    The   High   Court,   vide   its   impugned   judgment, 



      reduced   the   compensation   to   Rs.85,000/-   along 



      with   interest   at   the   rate   of   12%   p.a.,   the 



      relevant   portion   of   High   Court   judgment   reads   as 



      follows:



      "Heard   both   sides.   The   learned   Government 

      Pleader submits that father was aged about 

      70   years   even   at   the   time   of   the   accident 

      and   therefore   the   Tribunal   had   committed 

      an   error   in   fixing   the   multiplier   at   16 

      whereas   it   has   to   only   apply   a   multiplier 

      of   5.   In   the   award,   the   age   of   first 

      claimant   is   not   shown   but   the   daughter   of 

      the   first   claimant   namely   Leela   has   filed 

      an affidavit before this Court for getting 

      impleaded as I.A. 1407/06 where her age is 

      shown as 61 years. So it is clear that she 

      would   be   49   years   at   the   time   of   the 

      accident and therefore even if the minimum 

      age   that   can   be   fixed   for   the   mother   will 

      be   67   years   and   not   less.   The   mother   is 




                                  4



       the   real   legal   representative   and   others 

       cannot         claim            the          status                 of         legal 

       representative                   and              therefore                              the 

       appropriate   multiplier   to   be   used   in   this 

       case   is   only   5.   It   is   true   that   the 

       Tribunal            has         taken             his              income                at 

       Rs.1,200/-   per   month   whereas   claimants 

       claimed   that   the   deceased   was   getting   an 

       amount of Rs.1,500/- as his income. We fix 

       it   at   Rs.1,500/-   deduct   1/3rd  for   personal 

       expenses   and   applying   a   multiplier   of   5 

       the   loss   of   dependency   compensation   would 

       come   to   Rs.60,000/-.   The   Tribunal   has 

       awarded   Rs.15,000/-   towards   pain   and 

       suffering,                      Rs.1,000/-                                towards 

       transportation   charges   and   Rs.2,000/-   for 

       funeral   expenses.   They   are   only   just   and 

       reasonable   and   we   do   not   find   any   ground 

       to   interfere   with   the   same.   But   the 

       Tribunal   has   not   awarded   any   amount 

       towards   love   and   affection.   Hence,   we 

       grant   an   amount   of   Rs.5,000/-   under   that 

       head   and   also   award   a   sum   of   Rs.2,500/- 

       towards   loss   of   estate.   Therefore,   the 

       total   compensation   that   the   claimants   are 

       entitled to will be Rs.85,000/-."






9.     Aggrieved   with   the   judgment   of   the   High   Court, 



       the   appellants   (claimants)   filed   a   Special   Leave 



       Petition before this Court.



10.    On   the   question   of   fixing   the   quantum   of 



       compensation   in   motor   accident   claim   cases,   this 



       Court has laid down several guidelines.



                                               5


11.    In   the   case   of  Concord   of   India   Insurance   Co. 



 
Ltd.  v.  Nirmala   Devi
  [(1979)   118   ITR   507(SC)], 



       Justice   Krishna   Iyer,   speaking   for   a   Bench   of 



       this   Court,   observed   that   the   determination   of 



       compensation must be liberal, not niggardly since 



       the law values life and limb in a free country in 



       generous scales.




12.    
In the case of 
General Manager, Kerala State Road 



       Transport Corporation, Trivandrum v. Mrs. Susamma 



       Thomas   and   Ors.
  [AIR   1994   SC   1631],   this   Court 



       held that:




       "The   assessment   of   damages   to   compensate 

       the   dependants   is   beset   with   difficulties 

       because   from   the   nature   of   things,   it   has 

       to   take   into   account   many   imponderables, 

       e.g.,   the   life   expectancy   of   the   deceased 

       and   the   dependants,   the   amount   that   the 

       deceased   would   have   earned   during   the 

       remainder   of   his   life,   the   amount   that   he 

       would   have   contributed   to   the   dependants 

       during   that   period,   the   chances   that   the 

       deceased   may   not   have   lived   or   the 

       dependants   may   not   live   up   to   the 

       estimated   remaining   period   of   their   life 

       expectancy,   the   chances   that   the   deceased 

       might have got better employment or income 

       or   might   have   lost   his   employment   or 

       income together.



       The   manner   of   arriving   at   the   damages   is 

       to   ascertain   the   net   income   of   the 

       deceased   available   for   the   support   of 

       himself   and   his   dependants,   and   to   deduct 




                                  6



       therefrom   such   part   of   his   income   as   the 

       deceased   was   accustomed   to   spend   upon 

       himself, as regards both self- maintenance 

       and   pleasure,   and   to   ascertain   what   part 

       of   his   net   income   the   deceased   was 

       accustomed to spend for the benefit of the 

       dependants.                    Then              that              should         be 

       capitalized   by   multiplying   it   by   a   figure 

       representing   the   proper   number   of   year's 

       purchase.



       Much         of         the         calculation                    necessarily 

       remains in the realm of hypothesis "and in 

       that   region   arithmetic   is   a   good   servant 

       but a bad master" since there are so often 

       many   imponderables.   In   every   case   "it   is 

       the   overall   picture   that   matters"   and   the 

       court must try to assess as best as it can 

       the loss suffered."





13.    The Bench also observed that the proper method of 



       computation   is   the   multiplier-method,   which   was 



       an   accepted   method   of   arriving   at   `just' 



       compensation.   Any   departure,   save   in   exceptional 



       and          extraordinary                       cases,             would         introduce 



       inconsistency   of   principle,   lack   of   uniformity 



       and   an   element   of   unpredictability   for   the 



       assessment   of   compensation.   Further,   the   Bench 



       held   that   the   multiplier   was   determined   by   two 



       factors, namely, the rate of interest appropriate 



       to   a   stable   economy   and   the   age   of   the   deceased 



       or of the claimant whichever was higher.



                                                   7


14.    The   principles   
laid   down   in
 
Susamma
  (supra)   were 



       upheld   in   the   case   of  
U.P.   State   Road   Transport 



       Corporation   and   Ors.  v.  Trilok   Chandra   and   Ors
.




       [(1996) 4 SCC 362].



15.    
In   the   case   of     
Tamil   Nadu   State   Transport 



       Corporation Ltd. v. S.
                                   Rajapriya 
                                                 
                                                 & 
                                                   Ors.
 [AIR 2005 



       SC  2985],  this  Court  observed  that  the  choice  of 



       the multiplier was to be determined by the age of 



       the   deceased   (or   that   of   the   claimants   whichever 



       is higher) and by the calculation as to what the 



       capital   sum,   if   invested   at   a   rate   of   interest 



       appropriate   to   a   stable   economy,   would   yield   by 



       way   of   annual   interest.   In   ascertaining   this, 



       regard   was   also   to   be   had   to   the   fact   that 



       ultimately   the   capital   sum   would   also   be 



       consumed-up   over   the   period   for   which   the 



       dependency was expected to last.




16.    
In  
United   India   Insurance   Co.   Ltd.  v.  Bindu   & 



       Ors.
     [(2009)   3   SCC   705],   this   Court   again 



       reiterated   that   the   choice   of   the   multiplier   was 




                                  8



       to   be   determined   by   the   age   of   the   deceased   (or 



       that of the claimants whichever is higher) and by 



       the   calculation   of   a   capital   sum   which,   if 



       invested   at   a   rate   of   interest   appropriate   to   a 



       stable   economy,   would   yield   by   way   of   annual 



       interest.




17.    
In  
Supe   Dei   (Smt)   &   Ors.  v.  National   Insurance 



       Co.   Ltd.   &   Anr.
  [(2009)   4   SCC   513],   the   Court 



       observed   that   while   considering   the   question   of 



       just   compensation   payable   in   a   case   all   relevant 



       factors   including   appropriate   multiplier   had   to 



       be considered, and that the Second Schedule under 



       Section   163-A   to   the   
Motor   Vehicles   Act,   1988
, 



       which   gave   amount   of   compensation   to   be 



       determined   for   purpose   of   claim   under   the 



       section,   could   be   taken   as   a   guideline   while 



       determining the compensation under 
Section 166
 of 



       the Act.

In  
Sarla   Verma   (Smt.)   &   Ors.  v.  Delhi   Transport 



       Corporation & Anr.
 [(2009) 6 SCC 121], this Court 






                                   9



formulated   the   principles   very   lucidly   and   which 



are quoted below:




"Basically   only   three   facts   need   to   be 

established by the claimants for assessing 

compensation in the case of death: 


(a) age of the deceased; 


(b) income of the deceased; and the 


(c) the number of dependents. 


The   issues   to   be   determined   by   the 

Tribunal   to   arrive   at   the   loss   of 

dependency are:



(i)   additions/deductions   to   be   made   for 

arriving at the income; 



(ii)   the   deduction   to   be   made   towards   the 

personal   living   expenses   of   the   deceased; 


and 


(iii)   the   multiplier   to   be   applied   with 

reference of the age of the deceased. 



If   these   determinants   are   standardized, 

there   will   be   uniformity   and   consistency 

in   the   decisions.   There   will   lesser   need 

for   detailed   evidence.   It   will   also   be 

easier   for   the   insurance   companies   to 

settle accident claims without delay. 



To   have   uniformity   and   consistency,   the 

Tribunals   should   determine   compensation   in 

cases   of   death,   by   the   following   well-



settled steps:



Step 1 (Ascertaining the multiplicand)

The   income   of   the   deceased   per   annum 

should   be   determined.   Out   of   the   said 

income   a   deduction   should   be   made   in 

regard   to   the   amount   which   the   deceased 

would   have   spent   on   himself   by   way   of 

personal and living expenses. The balance, 

which is considered to be the contribution 

to   the   dependant   family,   constitutes   the 

multiplicand.





Step 2 (Ascertaining the multiplier)






                           1



         Having   regard   to   the   age   of   the   deceased 

         and         period           of         active                 career,            the 

         appropriate   multiplier   should   be   selected. 

         This does not mean ascertaining the number 

         of years he would have lived or worked but 

         for the accident. Having regard to several 

         imponderables                in         life                  and          economic 

         factors,   a   table   of   multipliers   with 

         reference   to   the   age   has   been   identified 

         by   this   Court.   The   multiplier   should   be 

         chosen   from   the   said   table   with   reference 

         to the age of the deceased.





         Step 3 (Actual calculation)

         The   annual   contribution   to   the   family 

         (multiplicand)   when   multiplied   by   such 

         multiplier   gives   the   `loss   of   dependency' 

         to the family."





19.      Further,   this   Court   considered   the   principles 



         laid   down   in             Susamma          (supra),                 Trilok   Chandra 



         (supra)   and          New   India   Assurance   Co.   Ltd.                                    v. 



         Charlie   &   Anr.  [(2005)   10   SCC   720]   and   gave   the 



         following table for multiplier:

20.    In  the  present  case,  the  claimants  had  filed  for 



       compensation   under   
Section   166
   of   the   Motor 



       Vehicles   Act,   1988.   The   original   claim   petition 



       had   been   filed   by   the   mother   and   brother   of   the 






                                   1



       deceased   and   the   deceased   was   33   years   of   age 



       when he died in the accident.



21.    For   the   purpose   of   calculating   the   multiplier, 



       the   High   Court   held   that   mother   was   the   real 



       legal   representative   and   others   could   not   claim 



       to   be   the   legal   representatives   of   the   deceased, 



       and   accordingly   applied   a   multiplier   of   5, 



       whereas   the   Tribunal   had   calculated   compensation 



       by considering a multiplier of 16.



22.    This Court is of the opinion that the law as has 



       been   laid   correctly   in   the   case   of  
Sarla   Varma
 



       (supra),   in   a   very   well   considered   judgment,   is 



       to be followed.




23.    The   High   Court   unfortunately   took   a   very 



       technical   view   in   the   matter   of   applying   the 



       multiplier.     The   High   Court   cannot   keep   out   of 



       its   consideration   the   claim   of   the   daughter   of 



       the   first   claimant,   since   the   daughter   was 



       impleaded,  and  was  49  years  of  age.    Admittedly, 



       the deceased was looking after the entire family. 



                                  1


 
In   determining   the   age   of   the   mother,   the   High 



       Court  should  have  accepted  the  age  of  the  mother 



       at   65,   as   given   in   the   claim   petition,   since 



       there   is   no   controversy   on   that.     By   accepting 



       the   age   of   mother   at   67,   the   High   Court   further 



       reduced   the   multiplier   from   6   to   5,   even   if   we 



       accept   the   reasoning   of   the   High   Court   to   be 



       correct.   The reasoning of the High Court is not 



       correct   in   view   of   the   ratio   in  
Sarla   Verma
 



       (supra).        Following   the   same   the   High   Court 



       should have proceeded to compute the compensation 



       on the age of the deceased.




24.    Thus,   the   finding   of   the   High   Court   is   contrary 



       to the ratio in 
Sarla Verma
 (supra), which is the 



       leading   decision   on   this   question   and   which   we 



       follow.




25.    This   Court,   therefore,   cannot   sustain   the   High 



       Court   judgment   and   is   constrained   to   set   aside 



       the same.  The award of MACT is restored.



26.    The appeal is allowed.  No costs.
