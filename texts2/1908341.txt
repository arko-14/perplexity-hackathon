TGN KUMAR                                   --     APPELLANT


                                VERSUS


STATE OF KERALA & ORS.                      --     RESPONDENTS



                            JUDGMENT



D.K. JAIN, J.:





1. Challenge in this appeal, by special leave, is to the order dated 4th

  September, 2008 passed by a learned Single Judge of the High Court of

  Kerala in Crl. M.C. No.1977 of 2007 whereby a number of general

  directions have been issued to all the criminal courts, which are called

  upon to hold trials, particularly in cases involving an offence under

  
Section 138
 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881 (for short "the 
N.I.

  Act
"), as also in all other cases involving offences which are technical in

  nature and do not involve any moral turpitude.



                                                                          1


2. In view of the controversy at hand, it is unnecessary to state the facts

    giving rise to this appeal in detail, except to note that the present case

    arises out of a complaint filed under 
Section 138
 of the N.I. Act. On

    being summoned by the Magistrate, the accused preferred a petition

    before the High Court under 
Section 482
 of the Criminal Procedure

    Code, 1973 (for short "the Code"), inter alia, praying for dispensing with

    her personal appearance before the Magistrate. As afore-stated, the High

    Court, while allowing the said application, and permitting the accused to

    appear before the Trial Court through her counsel, felt that there was

    great need for rationalising, humanising and simplifying the procedure in

    criminal courts with particular emphasis on the attitude to the "criminal

    with no moral turpitude" or the criminal allegedly guilty of only a

    technical offence, including an offence under 
Section 138
 of the N.I. Act.

      and Helen Rubber Industries & Ors. Vs. State of Kerala & Ors.6, the

      learned Judge has issued the following `rules of guidance', with a

      direction that these can and must certainly be followed by the court

      below in the instant case as also by all criminal courts which are called

      upon to deal with trials under 
Section 138
 of the N.I. Act:-


          "i)    Hereafter in all 138 prosecutions, the very fact that
          the prosecution is one under 
Section 138
 of the
          Negotiable Instruments Act shall be reckoned as
          sufficient reason by all criminal courts to invoke the
          discretion under 
Section 205
 Cr.P.C and only a summons
          under 
Section 205
 Cr.P.C shall be issued by the criminal
          courts at the first instance. In all pending 138 cases also
          applications under 
Section 205
 Cr.P.C shall be allowed
          and the accused shall be permitted to appear through their
          counsel.



          ii)    The plea whether of guilty or of innocence can be
          recorded through counsel duly appointed and for that
          purpose personal presence of the accused shall not be
          insisted.



          iii) Evidence can be recorded in a trial under 
Section
          138
 of the Negotiable Instruments Act in the presence of
          the counsel as enabled by 
Section 273
 Cr.P.C when the
          accused is exempted from personal appearance and for
          that purpose, the personal presence of the accused shall
          not be insisted.



          iv) Examination under 
Section 313(b)
 Cr.P.C can be
          dispensed with under the proviso to Section 313(1) and if
          the accused files a statement explaining his stand, the
          same can be received by the court notwithstanding the
          absence of a provision similar to Section 233 and 243

    1972 K.L.T. 794



                                                                            3


Cr.P.C
 in the procedure for trial in a summons case. The
power and the obligation to question the accused to
enable him to explain the circumstances appearing in
evidence against him must oblige the court in such
situation to accept and consider the written statement
made by the accused.



 v) To receive the judgment also, it is not necessary
or essential to insist on the personal presence of the
accused if the sentence is one of fine or the judgment
is one of acquittal.         After the pronouncement of
judgment, the case can be posted to a specific date with
directions to the accused to appear in person to undergo
the sentence. By that date, it shall, of course, be open to
the accused to get the order of suspension of the superior
court produced before court.



vi) Where warrants are to be issued in a 138 prosecution,
ordinarily a bailable warrant under 
Section 88
 Cr.P.C
must be issued at the first instance before a non-bailable
warrant without any stipulations under 
Section 87
 Cr.P.C
is issued.



vii) The above stipulations can only be reckoned
as applicable in the ordinary circumstances and are not
intended to fetter the discretions of the court to follow
any different procedure if there be compelling need. In
such event, the orders/directions of the Magistrate shall
clearly show the specific reasons as to why deviations are
resorted to.



viii) Needless to say, any person having a grievance that
the above procedure has not been followed unjustifiably
shall always have the option of approaching this Court
for directions under 
Section 482
 Cr.P.C. The Sessions
Judges and the Chief Judicial Magistrates must also
ensure that these directions are followed in letter and
spirit by the subordinate courts. Commitment to human
rights and the yearning to ensure that courts are user
friendly are assets to a modern judicial personality and


                                                              4

      assessment of judicial performance by the superiors must
      make note of such commitments of a judicial officer.



       ix) Even though the above directions are issued with
      specific reference to prosecutions under 
Section 138
 of
      the Negotiable Instruments Act, they must be followed in
      all other cases also where the offence alleged is technical
      and involves no moral turpitude."



3. Being aggrieved with the order granting a general exemption to the

   accused from personal appearance before the Trial Court, the

   complainant has filed this appeal.





4. On 17th November, 2008, while granting leave in this matter, a bench of

   two learned judges referred the instant case to a larger Bench, posing the

   following question for determination:





      "One of the questions which arises for consideration in this
      special leave petition is as to whether the High court in exercise
      of its jurisdiction under 
Sections 482
 and 
483
 of the Code of the
      Criminal Procedure and/or under 
Article 227
 of the
      Constitution of India could issue guidelines directing all courts
      taking cognizance of offences under 
section 138
 of the
      Negotiable Instruments Act inter alia to invoke the discretion
      under 
Section 205
 of the Code of Criminal Procedure and only
      with a further direction that summons under Section 205 shall
      be issued at the first instance. Keeping in view importance of
      the question involved as also the various decisions of this Court
      upon which the learned Judge of the High Court has placed
      reliance, in our opinion, we think that this is a matter which
      should be heard by a larger Bench. It is directed accordingly."



                                                                           5


This is how the present appeal has been placed before this Bench.



5. Having heard learned counsel for the parties, we are convinced that the

   impugned order is unsustainable.





6. Section 205 of the Code, which clothes the Magistrate with the discretion

   to dispense with the personal appearance of the accused, reads as follows:



      "205. Magistrate may dispense with personal attendance of
      accused.--(1) Whenever a Magistrate issues a summons, he
      may, if he sees reason so to do, dispense with the personal
      attendance of' the accused and permit him to appear by his
      pleader.



      (2) But the Magistrate inquiring into or trying the case may,
      in his discretion, at any stage of' the proceedings, direct the
      personal attendance of the accused, and, if necessary, enforce
      such attendance in the manner hereinbefore provided."



7. The Section confers a discretion on the court to exempt an accused from

   personal appearance till such time his appearance is considered by the

   court to be not necessary during the trial. It is manifest from a plain

   reading of the provision that while considering an application under

   Section 205 of the Code, the Magistrate has to bear in mind the nature of

   the case as also the conduct of the person summoned. He shall examine

   whether any useful purpose would be served by requiring the personal

   attendance of the accused or whether the progress of the trial is likely to


                                                                           6

      be hampered on account of his absence. (See: S.V. Muzumdar & Ors.


      Vs. Gujarat State Fertilizer Co. Ltd. & Anr.7) .             Therefore, the

      satisfaction whether or not an accused deserves to be exempted from

      personal attendance has to be of the Magistrate, who is the master of the

      court in so far as the progress of the trial is concerned and none else.



8. 
In 
Bhaskar Industries Ltd.
 (supra), this Court had laid down the

      following guidelines, which are to be borne in mind while dealing with

      an application seeking dispensation with the personal appearance of an

      accused in a case under 
Section 138
 of the N.I. Act:


          "19. ...it is within the powers of a Magistrate and in his judicial
          discretion to dispense with the personal appearance of an
          accused either throughout or at any particular stage of such
          proceedings in a summons case, if the Magistrate finds that
          insistence of his personal presence would itself inflict enormous
          suffering or tribulations on him, and the comparative advantage
          would be less. Such discretion need be exercised only in rare
          instances where due to the far distance at which the accused
          resides or carries on business or on account of any physical or
          other good reasons the Magistrate feels that dispensing with the
          personal attendance of the accused would only be in the
          interests of justice. However, the Magistrate who grants such
          benefit to the accused must take the precautions enumerated
          above, as a matter of course."



7


    (2005) 4 SCC 173



                                                                                 7

We respectfully concur with the above guidelines and while re-affirming the

same, we would add that the order of the Magistrate should be such which

does not result in unnecessary harassment to the accused and at the same

time does not cause any prejudice to the complainant. The Court must

ensure that the exemption from personal appearance granted to an accused is

not abused to delay the trial.





9. In light of the afore-extracted legal principles, the impugned order is

      clearly erroneous in as much as the discretion of the Magistrate under

      Section 205 of the Code cannot be circumscribed by laying down any

      general directions in that behalf. 
In 
Manoj Narain Agrawal Vs. Shashi

      Agrawal & Ors.8
, this Court, while observing that the High Court cannot

      lay down directions for the exercise of discretion by the Magistrate under

      Section 205 of the Code, had echoed the following views:


          "Similarly, the High Court should not have, for all intent and
          purport, issued the direction for grant of exemption from
          personal appearance. Such a matter undoubtedly shall be left
          for the consideration before the learned Magistrate. We are sure
          that the Magistrate would exercise his jurisdiction in a fair and
          judicious manner."



10. It is equally trite that the inherent powers of the High Court under

      Section 482 of the Code have to be exercised sparingly with

8

    (2009) 6 SCC 385



                                                                              8

      circumspection, and in rare cases to correct patent illegalities or to

      prevent miscarriage of justice. 
In 
Madhu Limaye Vs. The State of

      Maharashtra9
, a Bench of three learned Judges of this Court had

      observed that:






          "...the following principles may be noticed in relation to the
          exercise of the inherent power of the High Court....: -



          (1) That the power is not to be resorted to if there is a specific
              provision in the Code for the redress of the grievance of
              the aggrieved party;



          (2) That it should be exercised very sparingly to prevent
              abuse of process of any Court or otherwise to secure the
              ends of justice;



          (3) That it should not be exercised as against the express bar
              of law engrafted in any other provision of the Code."



11. Similarly, while it is true that the power of superintendence conferred on

      the High Court under 
Article 227
 of the Constitution of India is both

      administrative and judicial, but such power is to be exercised sparingly

      and only in appropriate cases in order to keep the subordinate courts

      within the bounds of their authority. In any event, the power of

      superintendence cannot be exercised to influence the subordinate





9

    (1977) 4 SCC 551



                                                                               9

     judiciary to pass any order or judgment in a particular manner. 
In 
Jasbir

     Singh Vs. State of Punjab10
, this Court observed that:


        "So, even while invoking the provisions of 
Article 227
 of the
        Constitution, it is provided that the High Court would exercise
        such powers most sparingly and only in appropriate cases in
        order to keep the subordinate courts within the bounds of their
        authority. The power of superintendence exercised over the
        subordinate courts and tribunals does not imply that the High
        Court can intervene in the judicial functions of the lower
        judiciary. The independence of the subordinate courts in the
        discharge of their judicial functions is of paramount
        importance, just as the independence of the superior courts in
        the discharge of their judicial functions. It is the members of the
        subordinate judiciary who directly interact with the parties in
        the course of proceedings of the case and therefore, it is no less
        important that their independence should be protected
        effectively to the satisfaction of the litigants." (See also:

; 
Mohd. Yunus Vs. Mohd. Mustaqim & Ors.12

        and 
State, New Delhi Vs. Navjot Sandhu & Ors.13
.)


12. As regards direction (iv) supra to accept and consider the written

     statement made by the accused, in our opinion, it is again not in accord

     with the language of Section 313 of the Code as also the dictum laid

     down by this Court in 
Basavaraj R. Patil & Ors. Vs. State of Karnataka


10

   (2006) 8 SCC 294

11

   (1977) 2 SCC 437

12

   (1983) 4 SCC 566

13

   (2003) 6 SCC 641



                                                                              1

       & Ors.14. Section 313 of the Code deals with the personal examination of

       the accused, and provides that:






           "313. Power to examine the accused.--(1) In every inquiry or
           trial, for the purpose of enabling the accused personally to
           explain any circumstances appearing in the evidence against
           him, the Court--



           (a)    may at any stage, without previously warning the
                  accused, put such questions to him as the Court considers
                  necessary;

           (b)     shall, after the witnesses for the prosecution have been
                  examined and before he is called on for his defence,
                  question him generally on the case:



                    Provided that in a summons-case, where the Court has
           dispensed with the personal attendance of the accused, it may
           also dispense with his examination under clause (b).
           ............................................................................"

                                                          (emphasis supplied by us)



13.On the plain language of Section 313, it is evident that in a summons

       case, when the personal appearance of the accused has been dispensed

       with under Section 205 of the Code, a discretion is vested in the

       Magistrate to dispense with the rigour of personal examination of the

       accused under Section 313 of the Code as well.





14. 
In 
Basavaraj R. Patil & Ors.
 (supra) while advocating a pragmatic and

       humanistic approach in less serious offences, Thomas, J. speaking for the

14

     (2000) 8 SCC 740



                                                                                           1

   majority in a Bench of three learned Judges, explained the scope of

   clause (b) to Section 313(1) of the Code as follows :


      "The word "shall" in clause (b) to Section 313(1) of the Code is
      to be interpreted as obligatory on the court and it should be
      complied with when it is for the benefit of the accused. But if it
      works to his great prejudice and disadvantage the court should,
      in appropriate cases, e.g., if the accused satisfies the court that
      he is unable to reach the venue of the court, except by bearing
      huge expenditure or that he is unable to travel the long journey
      due to physical incapacity or some such other hardship, relieve
      him of such hardship and at the same time adopt a measure to
      comply with the requirements in Section 313 of the Code in a
      substantial manner. How could this be achieved?



        If the accused (who is already exempted from personally
      appearing in the court) makes an application to the court
      praying that he may be allowed to answer the questions without
      making his physical presence in court on account of justifying
      exigency the court can pass appropriate orders thereon,
      provided such application is accompanied by an affidavit sworn
      to by the accused himself containing the following matters:



      (a) A narration of facts to satisfy the court of his real
      difficulties to be physically present in court for giving such
      answers.

      (b)     An assurance that no prejudice would be caused to him,
      in any manner, by dispensing with his personal presence during
      such questioning.

      (c) An undertaking that he would not raise any grievance on
      that score at any stage of the case."



15.It is manifest from the afore-extracted passage that dispensation with the

   personal examination of an accused in terms of the said provision is




                                                                            1

   within the trial court's discretion, to be exercised keeping in view certain

   parameters, enumerated therein and not as a matter of course.



16.It is true that in direction (vii) supra, the learned Judge has clarified that

   the stipulations in the preceding paragraphs are not intended to fetter the

   discretion of the court to follow any different procedure, if there be

   compelling need but the requirement of recording `specific reasons' by

   the Magistrate for deviating from the directions given in the order, as

   stipulated in the same paragraph, in our view, is by itself tantamount to

   putting fetters on the jurisdiction of the Magistrate. This is not warranted

   in law.





17. Thus, in the instant case, we have no hesitation in holding that the High

   Court exceeded its jurisdiction under Section 482 of the Code and/or

   
Article 227
 of the Constitution by laying down the afore-extracted

   general directions, which are inconsistent with the clear language of

   Sections 205 and 313 of the Code, as noted above. We feel that in light

   of the afore-noted guidelines laid down by this Court, further directions

   on the same issue by the High Court were wholly uncalled for. 
In this





                                                                              1

       regard, the following observations in 
S. Palani Velayutham & Ors. Vs.

       District Collector, Tirunelveli, Tamil Nadu & Ors.15
, are quite apt:


           "The courts should avoid the temptation to become
           authoritarian. We have been coming across several instances,
           where in their anxiety to do justice, the courts have gone
           overboard, which results in injustice, rather than justice. It is
           said that all power is trust and with greater power comes greater
           responsibility."



18.In light of the foregoing discussion, the appeal is allowed, and the

       impugned order containing general directions to the lower courts is set

       aside. However, we direct that if the accused moves the trial court with

       an application under Section 205 of the Code for exemption from

       personal attendance within four weeks of the receipt of a copy of this

       judgment, the exemption granted to her by the High Court shall continue

       to be in force till her application is disposed of by the trial court.
