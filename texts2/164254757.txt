Bench: 
Harjit Singh Bedi
, 
Chandramauli Kr. Prasad


                              IN THE SUPREME COURT OF INDIA
                  CRIMINAL APPELLATE JURISDICTION

                CRIMINAL APPEAL NOS. 48-49 OF 2011
         (ARISING OUT OF SLP(CRL.) NOS. 123-124 OF 2011
                                      in
          SLP(CRL) Nos....  CRLMP 19500-19501 of 2010)



 SOHAN SINGH                                       ....    APPELLANT

                                  VERSUS

 RAM KISHAN SINGH                                  ..... RESPONDENT



                                O R D E R



         Delay condoned.



        Leave granted.



         The   compromise   entered   into   between   the   parties 

has   been  put   on  record,   which  reveals   that  the   parties 

had   compromised   their   disputes   in   the   High   Court   even 

before the revision petition had been disposed of by the 

High Court.   It appears that this fact was not brought 

to the notice of the High Court by the counsel for the 

parties.  



       In   this   view   of   the   matter,   we   allow   these 

appeals,   set   aside   the   orders   of   the   courts   below   and 

order the acquittal of the appellant.
