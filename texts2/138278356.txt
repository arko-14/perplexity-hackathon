                                      O R D E R



1.     This   judgment   will   dispose   of   Criminal   Appeal   No.   1198   of   2007 



and Special Leave Petition (Crl.) No. 5580 of 2008.   The facts have been 



taken from Criminal Appeal No. 1198 of 2007.



2.     At about 9 p.m. on the 26th  December 1991 Naranjan Singh PW-2 



son of Jaswant  Singh deceased a resident of village Vinjwan was in his 



house   along   with   his   father   when   there   was   a   knock   at   the   door. 



Naranjan Singh and his father, who happened to be the Sarpanch of the 



village,   thereupon   opened   the   door.     Two   Sikh   youth,   who   were 



subsequently   identified   as   the   appellants   herein,   Sukhbir   Singh   and 



Dilbagh   Singh,   were   standing   outside   carrying   AK-47   rifles.     They   told 



Jaswant Singh that he was raising an unnecessary dispute with regard 



to the school land, part of which under the possession of Mohanjit Singh, 



Amir  Singh and Bhupender Singh sons of Harbans  Singh (all  accused). 



Jaswant Singh answered  that he alone was not the deciding factor and

the   other   members   of 



the   Panchayat   and   the   Lambardar   be   also   called.     Jaswant   Singh   was 



then taken towards the house of Mohinder Singh Lambardar, by the two 



appellants followed  by Naranjan Singh.   Mohinder Singh too was called 



out   of   his   house   and   the   entire   group   then   went   on   to   the   house   of 



Hardev Singh, Member Panchayat.  Hardev Singh too was called out and 



the   appellants   told   them   that   the   dispute   should   be   settled   then   and 



there.     They   also   took   Jaswant   Singh,   Lambardar   Mohinder   Singh   and 



Member, Panchayat Hardev Singh towards the side of the school outside 



the village again followed by Naranjan Singh.   The three were thereafter 



told   to   sit  on   the   ground  whereupon   one   of   the   appellants   went   to   call 



Harbans   Singh   appellant.     He   returned   about   5/6   minutes   later 



accompanied by Harbans Singh and directed Jaswant Singh to stand up 



and   after   telling   him   that   he   alone   was   not   permitting   Harbans   Singh 



and his family to live peacefully and that he was attempting to construct 



a school building over his land, they fired a burst each from their rifles 



killing  Jaswant   Singh  on the  spot.    Naranjan  Singh  then  ran  away  but 



returned  after some  time  and seeing his father's  dead  body, left for the 



police   station.     He,   however,   came   across   a   police   party   at   about   4.45 



a.m. on the canal bridge near village Taragarh and made a statement to 



Inspector Jarnail Singh PW-8 and on its basis an FIR was registered  at 



Police   Station,   Sadar   Batala.     The   Special   Report   was   delivered   to   the 



Magistrate   in   Batala   itself   at   6.30   a.m.     In   the   FIR,   Naranjan   Singh 



                                Crl. Appeal No.1198/2007


                                                3

stated   that   two   Sikh 



youth   who   had   killed   his   father   were   militants   25-30   years   of   age,   of 



medium build, wearing kurta pajamas and that he could identify them, if 



confronted.  He further stated that he suspected that Harbans Singh and 



his sons Mohanjit Singh, Amir Singh and Bhupender Singh had entered 



into   a   conspiracy   along   with   the   appellants   to   commit   the   murder. 



Harbans Singh and his three sons were arrested soon after the incident 



but   Sukhbir   Singh   and   Dilbagh   Singh   were   arrested   on   the   21st  May 



1992   by   Sub-Inspector   Pyara   Singh.     On   the   completion   of   the 



investigation,   all   the   accused   were   brought   to   trial   for   offences 



punishable   under   section   302   read   with   
Section   149
   and   
120-B
   of   the 



IPC.  



3.        The   prosecution   in   support   of   its   case   placed   reliance   on   the 



evidence   of   Sukhdip   Singh   PW-1,   the   doctor   who   had   carried   out   the 



post-mortem   on   the  dead   body,  Naranjan   Singh   PW-2,  Mohinder   Singh 



Lambardar    PW-3 who too supported  the  prosecution story  and further 



stated that he had seen Harbans Singh and his sons talking to one of the 



appellants, and PW-8 Sub-Inspector Jarnail Singh who had recorded the 



statement of Naranjan Singh near the canal minor bridge and which had 



led to the registration of the formal FIR.  



4.        The   trial   court   relying   on  the   aforesaid   evidence   convicted   all   the 



accused   for   offences   punishable   under   
Section   120-B
   of   the   IPC   and 



                              Crl. Appeal No.1198/2007


                                              4

sentenced them to RI of 



7 years  and to fine,  Sukhbir Singh and Dilbagh Singh appellants under 




Section   302
   of   the   IPC   and   sentenced   them   to   life   imprisonment   along 



with   fine     and   Harbans   Singh,   Mohanjit   Singh,   Amir   Singh   and 



Bhupender  Singh under 
Section  302
/
149
 of the IPC also to serve a life 



sentence.   The matter was thereafter taken in appeal to the High Court 



and during the pendency of the appeal Harbans Singh passed away.  The 



appeal   against   him   has   dismissed   as   having   abated.     The   High   Court 



observed that there was no delay in the lodging of the FIR in which the 



names   of   Harbans   Singh,   Mohanjit   Singh,   Amir   Singh   and   Bhupender 



Singh   alias   Shastri   had   been   mentioned,   and   although   the   two   main 



accused (the appellants herein) had not been named, but they fitted the 



description given in the FIR and that further support with regard to the 



occurrence was to be found from the statements of Naranjan Singh and 



Mohinder   Singh   PWs.   as   to   the   manner   in   which   the   entire   incident 



happened   which   clearly   revealed   that   the   two   sets   of   accused   had 



entered   into   a   conspiracy   to   eliminate   Jaswant   Singh   as   he   was   an 



impediment in the efforts of Harbans Singh and others to take over the 



school   land.     The   High   Court   observed   that   the   two   primary  assailants 



Sukhbir Singh and Dilbagh Singh had opened fire on Jaswant Singh only 



after getting a green signal from Harbans Singh and his sons.  The Court 



also   observed   that   the   identification   of   the   appellants   in   Court   for   the 



first time fully satisfied the test of proper identification notwithstanding 



                               Crl. Appeal No.1198/2007


                                               5

the   fact   that   they   had 



been   arrested   long   after   the   incident   on   the   21st  May   1992   by   Sub-



Inspector   Pyara   Singh   who   had   not   been   produced   as   a   witness.     The 



High   Court   also   observed   that   as   PW-3   Mohinder   Singh   was   an 



independent   witness,   there   was   no   reason   whatsoever   to   disbelieve   his 



testimony.  Two appeals have been filed against the judgment of the High 



Court.  Criminal Appeal No. 1198 of 2007 by Sukhbir Singh and Dilbagh 



Singh   and   Special   Leave   Petition   (Crl)   No.   558   of   2008   by   Amir   Singh, 



Mohanjit   Singh   and   Bhupender   Singh.     We   grant   leave   in   this   Special 



Leave  Petition  as  well.    As  already  indicated  above, the  facts have  been 



taken from Criminal Appeal No. 1198 of 2007. 



5.      Mr.   Patwalia,   the   learned   senior   counsel   for   the   appellants   has 



raised one primary argument during the course of hearing of the appeals. 



He has pointed out that there was absolutely no evidence with regard to 



the   identification   of   the   appellants   and   their   identification   for   the   first 



time   in   Court   during   the   course   of   the   trial   would   not   be   sufficient   to 



record   a   conviction   in   the   absence   of   any   other   evidence.     
In   this 



connection,  the  learned  counsel has placed reliance on  
Dana Yadav vs. 



State   of   Bihar
  2002   (7)   SCC   295   and  Ramesh   vs.   State   of   Karnataka 



2009(15) SCC 35.
 
Mr. Kuldip Singh, the learned counsel has, however, 



placed reliance on  
Malkhansingh & Ors. vs.   State of M.P.
   2003(5) SCC 



746   to   contend   that   there   was   no   inflexible   rule   that   an   identification 



made   in   Court   for   first   time   could   not   be   taken   as   a   good   piece   of 



                                Crl. Appeal No.1198/2007


                                                6

evidence   and   as   in   the 



present   matter   the   description   of   the   appellants   had   been   given   in   the 



FIR that itself was a corroborative circumstance to the prosecution story.




Mr. Patwalia has also urged that once it was held that the appellants, the 



main accused were not involved in the incident as their identification was 



suspect, the involvement of the others with the aid of 
Section 120-B
 or 



149 of the 
IPC
 too could not be spelt out.  



6.      We   have   considered   the   arguments   advanced   by   the   learned 



counsel   for   the   parties.     It   will   be   seen   that   the   incident   happened   at 



about 9 p.m. on the 26th  December 1991.   In the FIR recorded about 8 



hours later, the appellants had been described as two Sikh youth 25/30 



years of age wearing kurta pajamas.  The appellants were arrested on the 



21st May 1992 by Sub-Inspector Pyara Singh, (who was not examined as 



a witness) and they were identified for the first time in Court by Naranjan 



Singh   on   the   21st  September   1993.     We   are   of   the   opinion   that   the 



physical description of the appellants given in the FIR would fit millions 



of youth in Punjab, and could not by itself pin the murder on them.  The 



prosecution   has   also   not   come   out   with   the   steps   in   the   investigation 



which had led to their identification as the primary assailants.  It was, in 



this   background,   obligatory   on   the   part   of   the   prosecution   to   have 



produced   Sub-Inspector   Pyara   Singh   who   could   have   testified   to   the 



steps in the investigation made by him which had enabled him to identify 



the   appellants   as   the   killers.     This   was   not   done.     In   this   view   of   the 



                               Crl. Appeal No.1198/2007


                                               7

matter,   the   judgments 



cited   by   Mr.   Patwalia   fully   apply   to   the   facts   of   the   case.     There   is 



absolutely no evidence other than in the identification in court made by 



Naranjan   Singh   long   after   the   incident.     It   is   true   that   there   is   no 



inflexible rule that an identification made for the first time in Court has 



to be always ruled out of consideration but the broad principle is that in 



the   background   there   is   no   other   evidence   against   an   accused   on 



identification in Court made long after the event is clearly not acceptable. 



The judgment cited by 
Mr. Kuldip Singh of Malkhansingh
's case (supra) 



is   on   the   facts   of   that   particular   case,   as   a   prosecutrix,   who   was   the 



victim   of   a   gang   rape,   had   identified   some   of   the   accused   for   the   first 



time   in   Court   on   which   this   Court   opined   that   the   identification   was 



acceptable as a good piece of evidence.




7.      We   now   consider   the   case   of   the   appellants   in   the   connected 



matter.   The suggestion made by the prosecution is that Sukhbir Singh 



and   Dilbagh   Singh   had   been   engaged   by   the   other   appellants   to   settle 



scores with Jaswant Singh as he was apparently an obstacle in their way 



with   respect   to   the   school   land.     We   have,   in   this   connection,   gone 



through the evidence of Naranjan Singh PW-2 and Mohinder Singh PW-3, 



in   the   background   of   these   facts.       We   are   of   the   opinion   that   the 



involvement of Sukhbir Singh and Dilbagh Singh has to be ruled out as 



they were not properly identified and the charge qua them under 
Section 



302
 read with 
Section 120-B
 of the IPC must fail.   It is the prosecution

                                              8

story   that   a   dispute 



regarding the school land existed between Jaswant Singh and Naranjan 



Singh   on   the   one   side   and   Harbans   Singh   and   his   sons   Amir   Singh, 



Mohanjit Singh and Bhupender Singh appellants on the other.  It is also 



clear   that   in   this   dispute   PW-3   Mohinder   Singh,   the   Lambardar   was 



siding with Jaswant Singh.  We have gone through the evidence of PW-2 



and PW-3 very  carefully.    We  see   very  substantial   improvements  in the 



statements made by PW-2 in Court vis-a-vis his statement made to the 



Police.   Confronted with these statements, he could not give any cogent 



explanation for making them.  It is also clear that except for his ipse-dixit 



with   regard  to   the   dispute,   there   is   no   other   evidence   that   any   dispute 



did   exist.     It   has   come   in   the   evidence   that   no   threat   had   ever   been 



received by Jaswant Singh from militants prior to the incident.   We are, 



therefore,   of   the   opinion   that   the   statement   of   this   witness   cannot   be 



relied   upon.     The   statement   of   PW-3   is   equally   uncertain.     PW-3   made 



very   substantial   improvements   in   his   evidence   as   well.     The   story   that 



after seeing the murder, he had not made any attempt to meet Naranjan 



Singh,   and   his   plea   that   after   the   incident   he   had   returned   home   and 



had gone to sleep is difficult to swallow as it would be contrary to normal 



human   behaviour.     He   also   stated   that   a   grant   of   Rs.1,00,000/-   had 



been received for the school about 12 days prior to the incident and that 



the Qanungo had demarcated the school land which was legitimately in 



possession of Harbans Singh.  No cogent evidence to this effect has been

produced          by         the 



prosecution.   We are,  therefore, of the opinion that the evidence of this 



witness cannot also be believed.  



8.     We therefore have no option but to allow Criminal Appeal No. 1198 



of   2007   as   well   as   Criminal   Appeal   No........../2011   arising   out   of   SLP 



(Crl.) No. 5580 of 2008 filed by Amir Singh and others.  The judgment of 



the trial court dated  7th  August 1997 and that of the High  Court  dated 



12th January 2007 are set aside.
