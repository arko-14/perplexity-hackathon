INDRA INDRA VIKRAM SINGH & ORS.                          ......APPELLANTS 


                                            Versus


     STATE OF M.P. & ANR.                                 .....RESPONDENTS





                                      O R D E R



           The appellants are the legal heirs of one Padmini Kuarba 

     who held the Lambardari lease in regard to certain villages in 

     Panna tehsil. The lease was granted on 7.12.1945 for 30 years 

     on   an   annual   rent   of   Rs.1242.25   payable   to   the   state 

     government.   The   said   Lambardar   continued   in   possession   in 

     pursuance   of   the   said   lease   from   1.1.1943   to   31.12.1953.   The 

     leasehold rights of Padmini Kuarba were taken over by the state 

     government, vide notification dated 22.12.1953 with effect from 

     1.1.1954   issued   under   the   
Vindhya   Pradesh   Abolition   of   Jagirs 

     and   Land   Reforms   Act,   1952
   (for   short   `1952   Act').   The 

     resumption was challenged by the Lambardar and ultimately this 

     Court   set   aside   the   resumption   by   judgment   dated   21.2.1961, 

     holding that her rights were not jagir rights. In pursuance of 


the   said   decision,   the   leased   villages   were   restored   to   the 

Lambardar   on   30.4.1961.   The   Lambardar   continued   in   possession 

from 30.4.1961   till 30.6.1966 when the Lambardari leases were 

abolished by notification dated 28.6.1966 issued under 
Section 

3
   of   the   Madhya   Pradesh   Swatwadharik   Adhikar   Sampati   (Vindhya 

Pradesh)   Adhiniyam,   1965   (for   short   `1965   Act').   As   a 

consequence, possession of the leased lands was taken over from 

her on 1.7.1966.





2.     The   Collector,   District   Panna,   by   order   dated   15.5.1968 

determined   the   gross   annual   income   to   be   Rs.18086.79,   the 

deductions   to   be   made   therefrom   to   be   Rs.4028.74   and   the   net 

income per annum as Rs.14058.05. By applying the multiplier of 

13/6,   he   arrived   at   the   compensation   as   Rs.30459.10.   He   also 

determined   the   income   from   the   lands   for   the   period   of 

unauthorized   occupation   by   the   Government   (1.1.1954   to 

30.4.1961)   as   Rs.11,557/65.   After,   deducting   the   certain 

amounts due to the Government he arrived at the amount payable 

to the Lambardar as Rs.22,939.30 made up as follows:




(i)      Compensation to the Lambardar
         under 
Section 4
 of Act 41 of 1965
         read with 
Section 10
 and 
14

         of Act XI of 1952 [compensation of                    Rs.11,381.65
         Rs.30459.10 minus Taccari dues
         (Rs.2928.20) and lease rentals due
         (Rs.16,149.28)]


(ii)     Income received from the leasehold
         lands during the period from 1.1.1954 
         to 30.4.1961 when possession has been 


         taken over under Act XI of 1952 (which
         was found to be illegal by this Court)                Rs.11,557.65



That order was affirmed by the Board of Revenue by order dated 

20.12.1968.   The   Lambardar   challenged   the   order   of   Board   of 

Revenue   and   the   High   Court   on   9.11.1970   quashed   the   order   of 

the   District   Collector   and   the   Board   of   Revenue   and   remanded 

the matter for fresh assessment, with an observation that the 

calculation   of   compensation   under   the   1952   Act,   should   be   by 

excluding   those   provisions   which   would   not   apply   to   the 

abolition of rights under the 1965 Act. The order of the High 

Court was challenged by the State and this Court by order dated 

16.7.1986   dismissed   the   appeal   filed   by   the   state   government 

and   directed   the   second   respondent   (District   Collector)   to 

determine the compensation in the light of the observations of 

the High Court in its order dated 9.11.1970.





3.    In pursuance of it, the second respondent passed a fresh 

order dated 30.5.1988 determining compensation. The Collector, 

by   reiterating   the   earlier   determination,   arrived   at   the 

average annual income to be Rs.18,086.79 and deductions to be 

made   as   Rs.4028.74.   Thus   he   arrived   at   the   net   income   as 

Rs.14,058.05 per annum. He determined the compensation payable 

as Rs.140,580/50, by applying a multiplier of 10. The Collector 

directed   that   Rs.19,077.45   due   from   the   Lambardar   to   the 

Government   (that   is   Rs.2928.20   towards   Taccavi   with   interest 


upto   15.5.1968   and   Rs.16,149.25   towards   lease   amount   for   13 

years   at   the   rate   of   Rs.1242.25   per   year)   should   be   deducted 

and the balance be paid to the legal heirs of the Lambardar. He 

also reiterated that a sum of Rs.11,557.65 being the income of 

the Lambardari for the period 1.1.1954 to 30.4.1961 be released 

to   legal   heirs   of   the   Lambardar.   He   awarded   interest   at   the 

rate   of   3=   per   annum   on   the   compensation   amount.   He   did   not 

however   grant   any   interest   on   the   income   determined   for   the 

period   1.1.1954   to   30.4.1961   on   the     ground   that   the   said 

amounts had been deposited on 6.4.1968 by the Tehsildar, Panna 

and District Forest Officer, Panna. The said determination was 

challenged   by   the   legal   heirs   of   the   deceased   Lambardar.   The 

High   Court   by   the   impugned   order   dated   7.5.2002   upheld   the 

determination   of   compensation   and   the   determination   of   income 

for   the   period   1.1.1954   to   30.4.1961.   The   High   Court   however 

modified the interest payable. While the Collector had granted 

interest   at   3=%   per   annum   in   terms   of   the   provisions   of   the 

Act, the High Court held that the said rate of interest would 

apply   only   upto   9.3.1987   and   the   interest   payable   from 

10.3.1987  will be  at the  rate of  6% per  annum, as  this Court 

had directed that the compensation should be determined within 

six months. The said order is challenged by the legal heirs of 

the Lambardar in these appeals by special leave.





4.    The   appellants   contend   that   the   calculation   of   the 


compensation   for   abolition   of   rights   under   the   1965   Act   was 

erroneous. They contended that the average annual income of the 

Lambardar   for   the   purpose   of   calculating   the   compensation   had 

to   be   computed   by   excluding   the   period   1.1.1954   to   30.4.1961 

(the period when the properties were in the possession of the 

State) and by dividing the income earned while the Lambardari 

was   under   the   management   of   the   Lambardar   by   the   number   of 

years during which she derived such income. The appellants also 

contended   that   the   calculation   of   income   from   the   Lambardari 

for   the   period   1.1.1954   to   30.4.1961   are   erroneous.   The 

appellants contended that award of interest at 3.5% per annum 

up to 9.3.1987 and 6% per annum from 10.3.1987 are very low and 

interest   should   be   awarded   at   15%   per   annum.     They   lastly 

contended that solatium should have been awarded. 


5.    The   High   Court   found   that   there   was   no   error   in   the 

calculation of the compensation. It found that the net annual 

income   for   purposes   of   determining   the   compensation   and   the 

income   from   1.1.1954   to   30.6.1961   calculated   by   the   Collector 

in the earlier order dated 15.5.1968 were not disturbed by the 

High Court while remanding the matter by order dated 9.11.1970 

and   what   was   found   to   be   incorrect   was   application   of   the 

multiplier   of   13/6.   On   remand,   the   Collector   had   correctly 

applied   the   multiplier   as   10   (instead   of   13/6   applied   in   the 

earlier   order)   for   arriving   at   the   compensation,   but   did   not 

disturb the calculation of net annual income or the income for 


the period 1.1.1954 to 30.4.1961. Therefore as rightly held by 

the   High   Court,   there   is   no   reason   to   interfere   with   the 

compensation amount and the income for the dispossession period 

determined by the Collector. The gross income, the net income 

and the total compensation has been rightly calculated in terms 

of clauses 3,4 and 6 of the Schedule to the 1952 Act. We also 

find   that   the   income   for   the   period   of   wrongful   possession 

(1.1.1954 to 30.4.1961) was also calculated as per law in the 

first   order   dated   15.5.1968   and   that   was   reiterated   in   the 

order dated 30.5.1988 on remand. The High Court has found that 

there   was   no   error   in   the   calculation   of   the   income   for 

1.1.1954 to 30.4.1961 and we find no reason to interfere with 

the said finding.  





6.    In so far as interest is concerned, we find that the rate 

of interest awarded is in accordance with 
Section 10(2)
 of the 

1952   Act.   When   the   statute   indicates   the   rate   of   interest   it 

cannot   be   changed.   Further,   the   High   Court   has   increased   the 

interest to 6% per annum, from 10.3.1987 (that is on the expiry 

of   six   months   from   the   date   on   which   this   Court   directed   the 

decision should be rendered). The question of solatium does not 

arise in the absence of any provision therefor in the statute.

SCC   149   and  Union   of   India   vs.   Parmal   Singh
  -   (2009)   1   SCC 

618].






7.     Therefore, we dismiss the appeals as having no merit.
