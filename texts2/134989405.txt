              IN THE SUPREME COURT OF INDIA

              CRIMINAL APPELLATE JURISDICTION

            CRIMINAL APPEAL NO.271 OF 2011
      (Arising out of SLP (Crl.) No.2854 of 2010)



Sou. Sandhya Manoj Wankhade               ... Appellant


          Vs.


Manoj Bhimrao Wankhade & Ors.             ... Respondents



                   J U D G M E N T



ALTAMAS KABIR, J.



1.    Leave granted.





2.    This Appeal is directed against the judgment

and   order    dated   5th   March,   2010,   passed   by   the

                                   2





Nagpur Bench of the Bombay High Court in Crl. W.P.

No.588 of 2009, inter alia, directing the Appellant

to vacate her matrimonial house and confirming the

order of the Sessions Judge deleting the names of

the other Respondents from the proceedings.



3.     The   Appellant        herein     was     married       to     the

Respondent      No.1    on    20th     January,      2005,     and   the

marriage was registered under the provisions of the


Special Marriage Act, 1954
. After her marriage, the

Appellant began to reside with the Respondent No.1

at     Khorej    Colony,      Amravati,       where     her     widowed

mother-in-law       and      sister-in-law,       the      Respondent

Nos.2 and 3 respectively, were residing.                      According

to the Appellant, the marriage began to turn sour

after about one year of the marriage and she was

even    assaulted      by    her    husband    and    by     the    other

respondents.       It is her specific case that on 16th

June,    2007,    she       was    mercilessly       beaten     by   the

Respondent No.1, which incident was reported to the

                                    3





police and a case under 
Section 498-A
 I.P.C. came

to be registered against him.





4.     In addition to the above, the Appellant appears

to     have    filed     a    complaint,            being    Misc.    Crl.

Application         No.203    of    2007,      on    16th   July,     2007,

against all the Respondents under 
Sections 12
, 
18
,


19
,    
20
     and   
22
   of   the       Protection     of    Women     from

Domestic Violence Act, 2005, hereinafter referred

to    as    "the     Domestic       Violence        Act,    2005".       An

application         filed     by    the       Appellant      before    the

Judicial Magistrate, First Class, Amravati, under


Section 23
 of the above Act was allowed by the

learned       Magistrate,      who       by   his    order    dated    16th

August, 2007, directed the Respondent No.1 husband

to pay interim maintenance to the Appellant at the

rate of        1,500/- per month from the date of the

application till the final disposal of the main

application and also restrained all the Respondents

from        dispossessing          the        Appellant       from     her

                                 4





matrimonial home at Khorej Colony, Amravati, till

the final disposal of the main application.



5.   It further appears that the said order of the

learned     Magistrate     dated       16th    August,    2007,     was

challenged by Respondent No.1 in Crl. Appeal No.115

of   2007        before   the        learned     Sessions     Judge,

Amravati, who by his order dated 2nd May, 2008,

dismissed the said appeal. Aggrieved by the orders

passed      by     the    learned       Sessions         Judge,     the

Respondent No.1 filed Criminal Application No.3034

of 2008 in the High Court under 
Section 482
 Cr.P.C.

challenging the order dated 16th August, 2007 of the

Judicial Magistrate, First Class, Amravati and the

order dated 2nd May, 2008 of the Sessions Judge,

Amravati. The said application was dismissed by the

High Court on 4th September, 2009.





6.   In the meanwhile, the Respondent No.2 filed an

application       in   Misc.    Crl.    Application        No.203    of

2007 in the Court of the Judicial Magistrate, First

                               5





Class, Amravati, praying for modification of its

order dated 16th August, 2007 and a direction to the

Appellant to leave the house of Respondent No.2.

The said application for modification was dismissed

by the learned Magistrate on 14th July, 2008 holding

that     it   was   not   maintainable.       Thereupon,      the

Respondent Nos.2 and 3 filed Crl. Appeal No.159 of

2008 on 11th August, 2008, under 
Section 29
 of the

Domestic Violence Act, 2005, questioning the orders

passed by the learned Magistrate on 16th August,

2007 and 14th July, 2008, on the ground that being

women they could not be made Respondents in the

proceedings     filed     by    the    Appellant    under     the

provisions of the 
Domestic Violence Act, 2005
, and

that   the    matrimonial      house   of   the   Appellant   at

Khorej    Colony,   Amravati,      belonged   exclusively     to

Ramabai, the Respondent No.2 and mother-in-law of

the Appellant and did not, therefore, come within

the definition of "shared house". The said Criminal

Appeal No.159 of 2008 was allowed by the learned

                                6





Sessions Judge vide his judgment dated 15th July,

2009.     The learned Sessions Judge allowed Criminal

Appeal No.159 of 2008 and set aside the judgment

and order dated 14th July, 2008 and also modified

the order dated 16th August, 2007, to the extent of

setting     aside       the   injunction     restraining      the

Respondents        from   dispossessing      or   evicting    the

Appellant        from   her   matrimonial    house   at    Khorej

Colony, Amravati.         The Respondent No.1 husband was

directed to provide separate accommodation for the

residence of the Appellant or to pay a sum of

1,000/- per month to the Appellant from the date of

filing of the application till its final decision,

in lieu of providing accommodation.





7.      In Criminal Writ Petition No.588 of 2009, the

Appellant herein challenged the judgment and order

dated     15th    July,   2009,     passed   by   the     learned

Sessions Judge, Amravati, in Crl. Appeal No.159 of

2008, claiming that she had a right to stay in her

                               7





matrimonial    house.   Although,          the   question     as   to

whether a female member of the husband's family

could be made a party to the proceedings under the


Domestic Violence Act, 2005
, had been raised in

Crl. Appeal No.159 of 2008, the learned Sessions

Judge in his order dated 15th July, 2009, did not

decide the said question and did not absolve the

Respondent Nos.2 and 3 herein in his order, but

only observed that female members cannot be made

parties in proceedings under the 
Domestic Violence

Act, 2005
, as "females" are not included in the

definition of "respondent" in 
Section 2(q)
 of the

said Act.





8.   The    learned   Single       Judge    of   the   High   Court

disposed of the writ petition by his judgment and

order dated 5th March, 2010, with a direction to the

Appellant to vacate her matrimonial house, which

was in the name of the Respondent No.2, with a

further direction to the Trial Court to expedite

                               8





the hearing of the Misc. Crl. Application No.203 of

2007 filed by the Appellant herein and to decide

the same within a period of six months.           A further

direction was given confirming the order relating

to deletion of the names of the `other members'.



9.   Questioning the said judgment and order of the

Nagpur Bench of the Bombay High Court, Mr. Garvesh

Kabra,        learned    Advocate    appearing        for    the

Appellant, submitted that the High Court had erred

in confirming the order of the learned Sessions

Judge    in     regard   to   deletion   of   names     of   the

Respondent Nos.2 and 3 from the proceedings, upon

confirmation of the finding of the Sessions Judge

that no female could be made a party to a petition

under the 
Domestic Violence Act, 2005
, since the

expression "female" had not been included in the

definition of "respondent" in the said Act. Mr.

Kabra submitted that it would be evident from a

plain reading of the proviso to 
Section 2(q)
 of the

                               9





Domestic    Violence    Act,       2005,    that    a     wife   or   a

female living in a relationship in the nature of

marriage can, not only file a complaint against her

husband or male partner but also against relatives

of the husband or male partner. The term "relative"

not having been defined in the Act, it could not be

said that it excluded females from its operation.



10. Mr.     Satyajit     A.        Desai,    learned        Advocate

appearing for the Respondents, on the other hand,

defended the orders passed by the Sessions Judge

and   the   High     Court     and    urged        that    the   term

"relative" must be deemed to include within its

ambit only male members of the husband's family or

the family of the male partner.                    Learned counsel

submitted that when the expression "female" had not

been specifically included within the definition of

"respondent"    in     Section       2(q)     of     the    Domestic

Violence Act, 2005, it has to be held that it was

                           10





the intention of the legislature to exclude female

members from the ambit thereof.





11. Having     carefully   considered    the   submissions

made on behalf of the respective parties, we are

unable   to    sustain   the    decisions,   both   of   the

learned Sessions Judge as also the High Court, in

relation to the interpretation of the expression

"respondent"     in   Section    2(q)   of   the    Domestic

Violence Act, 2005.        For the sake of reference,


Section 2(q)
 of the above-said Act is extracted

hereinbelow :-





    "2(q). "respondent" means any adult male
    person who is, or has been, in a domestic
    relationship with the aggrieved person and
    against whom the aggrieved person has
    sought any relief under this Act:



        Provided that an aggrieved wife or
    female living in a relationship in the
    nature of a marriage may also file a
    complaint   against  a   relative of the
    husband or the male partner."

                                11


12. From the above definition it would be apparent

that although 
Section 2(q)
 defines a respondent to

mean any adult male person, who is or has been in a

domestic   relationship        with       the    aggrieved   person,

the proviso widens the scope of the said definition

by   including    a    relative      of    the    husband    or   male

partner within the scope of a complaint, which may

be filed by an aggrieved wife or a female living in

a relationship in the nature of a marriage.



13. It is true that the expression "female" has not

been used in the proviso to 
Section 2(q)
 also, but,

on the other hand, if the Legislature intended to

exclude females from the ambit of the complaint,

which can be filed by an aggrieved wife, females

would have been specifically excluded, instead of

it being provided in the proviso that a complaint

could   also    be     filed   against      a     relative   of    the

husband    or    the    male    partner.           No   restrictive

meaning    has        been     given       to     the    expression

                            12





"relative",    nor    has   the    said     expression     been

specifically defined in the 
Domestic Violence Act,

2005
, to make it specific to males only.



14. In such circumstances, it is clear that the

legislature    never    intended       to   exclude      female

relatives of the husband or male partner from the

ambit of a complaint that can be made under the

provisions of the 
Domestic Violence Act, 2005
.



15. In our view, both the Sessions Judge and the

High   Court   went    wrong      in   holding    otherwise,

possibly being influenced by the definition of the

expression "respondent" in the main body of 
Section

2(q)
 of the aforesaid Act.





16. The Appeal, therefore, succeeds.           The judgments

and orders, both of the learned Sessions Judge,

Amravati, dated 15th        July, 2009 and the Nagpur

Bench of the Bombay High Court dated 5th March,

2010, in Crl. Writ Petition No.588 of 2009 are set

                          13





aside.   Consequently,   the   trial    Court              shall             also

proceed against the said Respondent Nos.2 and 3 on

the complaint filed by the Appellant.



17. The appeal is allowed accordingly.
