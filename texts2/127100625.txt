              The   respondents   have   been   served   but   they   are   not 

     represented before us.



              As per the prosecution story on the 2nd  April, 1989 

     at about 11.45 p.m. the prosecutrix, the daughter in law of 

     Santu,   was   sleeping   in   her   in   laws'   house   along   with   her 

     daughter and other family members. Her husband was however 

     away to the Punjab in connection with his employment. On an 


alarm raised by the prosecutrix all those at home woke up 

and   saw   that   the   appellant   was   committing   rape   on   the 

prosecutrix.   The appellant was accordingly apprehended on 

the spot with the help of a police party which was passing 

close  by.       It  was   also  noticed   that  the   prosecutrix  was 

bleeding   from   her   private   parts.     The   appellant   was 

accordingly   brought   to   the   police   station   where   a   report 

was   lodged   and   a   case   under   
Section   376
   of   the   IPC   was 





registered.  





                                   -2-


         The Trial Court relying on the evidence of PW.1 the 

prosecutrix,   PW.2   Santu,   her   father-in-law,   and   PW.6,   her 

sister-in-law,  held   that  the   case  against   the  accused   was 

made out and accordingly sentenced him to undergo R.I. for 

seven years.  The matter was thereafter taken in appeal to 

the High Court and the High Court while observing that the 

facts   of   the   case   indicated   that   the   prosecutrix   was   a 

consenting party thought that in the circumstance it was a 





fit case where the sentence ought to be reduced from seven 

to five years.   The appeal was nevertheless dismissed with 

the reduction in the quantum of sentence.   This appeal by 

way of special leave is now before us.



         We have heard the learned counsel for the appellant. 

He has  raised only one argument before us.  He has pointed 

out that the prosecutrix was 26 years of age as on the date 

of   the   incident   and   was   the   mother   of   seven   children   and 


the very fact that the rape had been allegedly committed in 

her   house   not   only   in   the   presence   of   her   children   and 

other     family   members,     the   story   itself   appeared   to   be 

unacceptable.   It   has   also   been   highlighted   that   in   the 

background   of     the   fact   that   the   High   Court   had   observed 

that   the   prosecutrix   was   a   consenting   party   the   accused 

ought to have been acquitted on that basis alone.  


         We find merit in this plea.  We find that under the 





circumstance the possibility that rape could have been 






                                   -3-


committed  on   her  in   the  presence   of  so   many  members   in  a 

small house is difficult to believe.   On the contrary the 


findings   of   the   High   Court   that   the   prosecutrix   was   a 

consenting   party   appear   to   be   correct   and   it   was   perhaps 

when the accused and the prosecutrix had been caught red-

handed   that   the   story   of   rape   had   been   cooked   up,   to 

salvage   some   of   the   family   honour.   This   is   often   the 

tendency in such matters. The High Court has therefore gone 

completely   wrong   in   dismissing   the   appeal   even   after   its 

categoric   observations.   We   accordingly   allow   the   appeal, 





set   aside   the   conviction   of   the   appellant   and   order   his 

acquittal.     The   appellant   is   on   bail;   his   bail   bonds   are 

discharged.
