                 IN THE SUPREME COURT OF INDIA

               CRIMINAL  APPELLATE JURISDICTION 



         CRIMINAL APPEAL NOS. 255-256   OF 2011

      (Arising out of SLP(Crl.) Nos. 7672-7673/2009)



VEENA                                     Appellant(s)

                     :VERSUS:

STATE GOVT. OF NCT, DELHI AND ANR.         Respondent(s)





                            O R D E R



       Leave granted.



       The appellant Veena and respondent No.2 - Jagdish 

Prasad   are   present   in   Court.   They   were   married   on 

30.9.1998. Out of the wedlock, they have one daughter who 

is in the custody of the appellant Veena. 





       It   is   not   disputed   that   the   parties   have   been 

living separately for over 10 years and reconciliation is 

not possible now. Both the appellant Veena and respondent 

No.2   Jagdish   Prasad   pray   that   a   decree   of   divorce   by 

mutual consent be granted.  





                                2


       The appellant Veena undertakes to withdraw all the 

cases filed by her against Jagdish Prasad and his family 

members,   including   the   one   filed   under   
Section   498A
   of 

the   I.P.C.,   within   two   weeks   from   today.   She   also 

undertakes not to claim any maintenance for her daughter 

or for herself.  





       Respondent   No.2   Jagdish   Prasad   undertakes   to 

withdraw   Case   No.248/2004   P.S.   Golakpuri,   under   
Section 

340
   of   the   Cr.P.C.,   pending   before   the   Court   of   Shri 

Rakesh   Pandit,   Metropolitan   Magistrate,   Karkardooma 

Courts, Delhi, within two weeks from today. 





       We have heard the learned counsel for the parties 

and   talked   to   the   parties.   The   appellant   has   filed   a 

divorce   petition   under   
Section   13(1)(ia)
   of   the   Hindu 

Marriage   Act,   1955,   being   HMA   No.397/2008   which   is 

pending   before   the   Court   of   Sanjeev   Mattu,   Additional 

District   Judge,   Karkardooma   Courts,   Delhi.   In   the 

peculiar facts and circumstances of this case, we deem it 

appropriate to transfer the said divorce petition to this 

Court   and   take   the   same   on   Board.   The   said   divorce 

petition is converted into one under 
Section 13B
 of the 

Hindu Marriage Act and we grant divorce to the parties by 

mutual consent.





                               3


       We direct  that the  custody of  the daughter  would 

continue to remain with the appellant.  





       We   may   observe   that   the   mere   filing   of   the 

petition by the appellant would not come in the way of 

the   father   of   respondent   No.2   receiving   pensionary   and 

other benefits  which are permissible them under law.


       With   these   observations,   these   appeals   are 

disposed of.
