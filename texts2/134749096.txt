                                     AMIR CHAND & ORS.

                            (Civil Appeal No. 1082 of 2011)

                                       JANUARY 28, 2011

         [G.S. SINGHVI AND ASOK KUMAR GANGULY, JJ.]

                                          2011(1) SCR 1096





      The Judgment of the Court was delivered by


      GANGULY, J. 1. Heard learned counsel for the appellant.


      2. Despite service of notice on the respondent Nos.2 and 3, nobody appeared.


      3. The appellant is impugning herein the judgment and order of the High Court of 

Punjab and Haryana dated 8th October, 2009 in FAO No.2484 of 2009. An appeal was 

filed before the High Court by the owner of the scooter, Amir Chand, against an award 

dated 12.2.2009 passed by the Motor Accident Claims Tribunal, Fast Track Court, Hisar, 

awarding to the appellant, compensation of Rs.1,36,547/- along with 9% interest.



      4. The contention of the owner of the scooter, before the High Court, was that the 

accident   and   his   involvement   in   it   was   not   proved   and   the   claim   petition   should   have 

been dismissed. The High Court ultimately upheld the appeal of the owner and set aside 

the findings of the Tribunal.





      5.   The   material   facts   are   that   on   22.01.2003   at   about   12.00   noon   the   appellant 

herein,   the   claimant   before   the   Tribunal,   respondent   No.1   before   the   High   Court,   was 

going   from   Baganwala   to   Tosham   on   a   Motor   Cycle   (No.HR   16C-8379),   driven   by 

Balwan with the claimant on the pillion seat. When the Motor Cycle was half a kilometer 

away from Baganwala, Suresh - respondent No.2 herein, came from the other direction 

in   another   scooter   (No.HR   20-5793)   from   the   wrong   side   and   hit   the   right   leg   of   the 

appellant   as   a   result   of   which   she   fell   down   and   her   right   leg   was   fractured   and   she 

received   multiple   injuries.   The   accident   was   witnessed  by   certain   persons   and   one   of 

them, Umed Singh, took the appellant to Dr. Punia's clinic from where she was referred 

to Chawla Nursing Home, Hisar, where she remained admitted till 6.2.2003. The matter 

was   also   reported   to   SSP,   Hisar.   Ultimately,   the   claim   petition   was   filed   by   her   on 

account of her serious injuries.





      6.  The  Tribunal  in  its  judgment  considered  the  evidence  of  PW.1-Umed Singh  as 

also   the   evidence   of   Dr.   Parveen   Chawla-PW.2,   Dr.   R.S.   Dalal   as   PW.5   apart   from 

examining   the   appellant-PW.4   and   also   one   Satbir   Singh   as   PW.3.     It   has   come   on 

evidence   of   PW.2-Dr.   Parveen   Chawla   that   on   22.1.2003   the   appellant   was   admitted 

with   diagnosis   of   fracture   of   tibia.     Plating   and   bone   grafting   was   done   by   P.W.2-Dr. 

Parveen Chawla and the appellant was discharged on 6.2.2003. The discharge card was 

also   proved.   PW.3-Satbir   Singh   deposed   that   the   appellant   moved   a   complaint   in   the 

office of SSP Hisar on 11.3.2003 and the same was sent in original on 2.4.2003 by SSP 

Hisar to SSP Hanumangarh.   PW.5-Dr. R.S. Dalal also deposed that the appellant was 

examined   on   17.12.2003   by   a   Medical   Board   comprising   of   Civil   Surgeon   Dr.   O.P. 

Phogat, Orthopedic Surgeon Dr. T.S. Bagri and Dr. Dayal himself and on examination 

the appellant was found to have 32% permanent disability.  In view of combined fracture 

of   both   bones   of   her   right   leg,   her   leg   was   shortened   by   two   inch.     The   disability 

certificate was also proved.





      7.   The   Tribunal   also   considered   the   evidence   of   RW.1-Amit   Chand   and   RW2-

Suresh   Kumar.     Apart   from   the   aforesaid   evidence,   the   Tribunal   also   considered   the 

detailed account of the accident given by the appellant as PW.4.



      8. This Court finds that on consideration of the aforesaid materials on record, the 

Tribunal   granted   compensation   to   the   appellant   to   the   extent   of   Rs.1,36,547/-   with 

interest at 9% per annum from the date of filing of the petition till its realization.



      9. This Court finds that the compensation is certainly not an excessive one. Rather 

the computation has been made modestly.





      10.   Unfortunately,   this   Court   finds   that   the   said   well   considered   decision   of   the 

Tribunal   was   set   aside   by  the   High   Court,   inter   alia,   on   the   ground   that   even   though 

complaint was forwarded to SSP Hisar and was further forwarded to SSP Hanumangarh 

but none from the office of SSP, Hanumangarh came to prove the complaint. The filing 

of   the   complaint   by   the   appellant   is   not   disputed   as   it   appears   from   the   evidence   of 

PW.3-Satbir Singh, who is the Assistant Complaint Clerk in the office of Superintendent 

of Police, Hisar.  If the filing of the complaint is not disputed, the decision of the Tribunal 

cannot be reversed on the ground that nobody came from the office of SSP to prove the 

complaint.     The   official   procedure   in   matters   of   proceeding   with   the   complaint   is   not 

within the control of the appellant, who is an ordinary village woman. She is not coming 

from the upper echelon of society. The general apathy of the administration in dealing 

with   complaints   lodged   by  ordinary  citizens   is  far  too   well  known  to   be   overlooked   by 


High Court. In this regard the perception of the High Court in disbelieving the complaint 

betrays a lack of sensitized approach to the plight of a victim in a motor accident claim 

case.





      11. The other ground on which the High Court dismissed the case was by way of 

disbelieving   the   testimony   of   Umed   Singh-PW.1.   Such   disbelief   of   the   High   Court   is 

totally   conjectural.   Umed   Singh   is   not   related   to   the   appellant   but   as   a   good   citizen, 

Umed   Singh   extended   his   help   to   the   appellant   by   helping   her   to   reach   the   Doctor's 

chamber in order to ensure that an injured woman gets medical treatment. The evidence 

of Umed Singh cannot be disbelieved just because he did not file a complaint himself.



 
12. We are constrained to repeat our observation that the total approach of the High 

Court,   unfortunately,   was   not   sensitized   enough   to   appreciate   the   plight   of   the   victim. 

The other so-called reason in the High Court's order was that as the claim petition was 

filed   after   four  months  of  the  accident,   the  same   is  "a  device   to   grab  money  from  the 

insurance company". This finding in the absence of  any material  is certainly  perverse. 

The High Court appears to be not cognizant of the principle that in a road accident claim, 

the   strict   principles   of   proof   in   a   criminal   case   are   not   attracted.   The   following 

observations   of   this   Court   in  
Bimla   Devi   and   others   vs.   Himachal   Road   Transport  

Corporation and others
 [(2009) 13 SCC 530] are very pertinent.


      "In   a   situation   of   this   nature,   the   Tribunal   has   rightly   taken   a   holistic   view   of   the 

      matter. It was necessary to be borne in mind that strict proof of an accident caused 

      by a particular bus in a particular manner may not be possible to be done by the 

      claimants. The claimants were merely to establish their case on the touchstone of 

      preponderance of probability. The standard of proof beyond reasonable doubt could 

      not have been applied."





      13. This Court, therefore, is unable to sustain the judgment given by the High Court 

and quashes the same and restores that of the Tribunal.





      14.   The   entire   payment  of   the   compensation   amount   must   be   deposited   with   the 

Tribunal in terms of its award within a period of six weeks from today by a demand draft 

and thereupon the Tribunal will immediately send notice to the appellant and handover 

the   demand   draft   to   the   appellant   only   within   two   weeks   thereafter.     The   copy   of   the 

order may immediately be transmitted to the Tribunal.





      15. The appeal is, thus, allowed with the aforesaid directions and observations.
