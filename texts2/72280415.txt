                 CIVIL APPEAL NO(s). 682 OF 2011
                   (@ SLP (C) No.12743/2010)


ORIENTAL INSURANCE CO.LTD.                             Appellant(s)

                VERSUS

DHANBAI KANJI GADHVI & ORS.                        Respondent(s)

                          O R D E R



       Leave granted.



             This appeal is directed against the judgment

 dated 15.1.2010 rendered by the learned Single Judge of

 the High Court of Gujarat at Ahmedabad in Special Civil

 Application No.9400 of 2006 by which the order dated

 23.12.2005 passed by the Motor Accident Claims Tribunal

 (MACT) Bhuj, Kachchh in M.A.C.P. No.759/97 permitting

 the respondents, who had already obtained compensation

 under 
Section 163A
 of the Motor Vehicles Act 1988 (`the

 Act' for short), to proceed with the application filed

 under 
section 166
 of the Motor Vehicles Act 1988, is

 affirmed.



             The respondents are the original claimants. On

 17.6.97, the deceased viz. Kanji Keshavbhai Gadhvi was

 riding his two wheeler i.e. Luna. When he reached near

 IFFCO, the driver of taxi bearing No.GJ-12-C-9484 who

 was   coming      from   the   opposite   direction    dashed the

                            - 2 -



taxi with the Luna as result of which Kanjibhai lost his

life. Therefore, the respondents                            who        are       legal

heirs     of    the     deceased respondent filed MACP No.759 of

1997 under 
Section 166
 of the Motor Vehicles Act against

the driver and owner of the taxi as well as against the

petitioner       who       is   insurer       of    the     taxi       and   claimed

compensation          of    Rs.7,50,000/-.            The     respondents          had

thereafter       filed       an    application        at      Exhibit        6   under


section 163A
 of the Act and claimed compensation of Rs.

3,93,500/- on the principle of no fault liability.


             The Tribunal had partly allowed the application

filed by the respondents under 
Section 163A
 of the Act

and ordered the petitioner to pay a sum of Rs.2,65,500/-

with 12% interest vide judgment dated 18.10.2000.                                  The

case    of     the    petitioner        is     that     the       petitioner       had

deposited       the    said       amount      and   the      respondents          have

already        withdrawn          and        invested        the        amount      of

compensation as directed by the Tribunal.


 
The      present      petitioner         filed       an    application

with a       prayer that the application filed under 
Section

166
    which     was       pending      be    rejected        in    view     of    the

decision of this Court in 
Oriental Insurance Co. Ltd.

Vs. Hansrajbhai V. Kodala & Ors.
 (2001) 5 SCC 175.


                                 - 3 -



          The Tribunal by order dated 25.6.2002 granted

stay of further proceedings of the petition filed under


Section   166
   of   the   Act   till    further   orders.   In   the

meanwhile, the petitioner challenged the award passed by

the Tribunal under 
Section 163A
 of the Act by filing

First Appeal No.3019 of 2007.           The   appeal was dismissed

on the ground of delay.



          The respondents thereafter filed an application

with a prayer that they be permitted to proceed with the

petition filed under 
Section 166
 of the Motor Vehicles

Act and they were ready to give undertaking to give

credit of the amount awarded to them as compensation in

the claim petition filed under 
Section 163A
 of the Act.

The Tribunal by an order dated 23.12.2005 permitted the

respondents to proceed with the petition filed under


Section 166
 of the Act. The Tribunal also directed that

amount already disbursed in favour of the respondents

and invested by them, pursuant to the award made under

Section 163A shall be adjusted to the final award to be

passed under 
Section 166
 of the Motor Vehicles Act.


          Feeling     aggrieved,    the       petitioner   preferred

Special Civil Application No.9400 of 2006 before the

High Court.

                                            - 4 -



     The    learned     Single      judge   of    the    High   Court    has

rejected the same by judgment dated 15.1.2010 giving

rise to the instant appeal.



            This Court has heard the learned counsel for

the parties.



            This Court has perused the impugned judgment of

the High Court.         The reasons given by the                High Court

for upholding permission granted by the Tribunal, to the

respondents to proceed further with the petition filed

under 
Section 166
 of the            Act, read as under.


            "After hearing and on perusal of the
            record and from the scheme of the Act, it
            is clear that proceedings under 
Sections
            163A
 and 
166
 of the Act i.e. both
            proceedings are permissible. In my view,
            claimant can file both the proceedings
            and opt for either of proceedings.    The
            only condition is that application for
            proceeding under 
section 166
 should be
            filed before the award is passed . Here,
            in this case, the proceedings were filed
            before the award is passed".



            On consideration of the object of section 163A

of the Act which was inserted by Section 51 of the Act

54   of    1994    w.e.f.     14-11-1994,        and    the   non-obstante

clause     with     which     sub-section         (1)    of     Sec.    163A

commences, it is manifest that the legislature did not

intend     to     prevent     the      claimant          from      getting

compensation       as   per    the

                                - 5 -



structured formula merely because in his original claim

petition       he had prayed for compensation on the basis of

"fault liability" principle.              There is no prohibition in

any provision of the 
Motor Vehicles Act
 1988 against the

claimant praying for compensation as per the structured

formula    after       having    filed     a   claim    petition    under


section 166
 of the Act.                 Therefore, this Court finds

that the respondents were perfectly justified in making

an application at Exhibit 6 in MACP                     No.759 of 1997

which was filed under 
Section 166
 of the Act and praying

the Tribunal to award compensation to them on the basis

of the structured formula mentioned in 
Section 163A
 of

the Act. This Court further finds that the Tribunal did

not    commit      any     error    in     entertaining       the    said

application      and     awarding   a    sum    of     Rs.2,65,500/-   as

compensation to the respondents under 
Section 136A
 of

the Act.



      However, in Deepal Girishbhai Soni & Ors.Vs. United

India Insurance Co. Ltd., Baroda (2004) 5 SCC 385, the

question which was considered by a three Judge Bench of

this Court was whether a proceeding under 
Section 163A


of the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988 is a final proceeding,

by    reason    whereof,     the    claimant who has been granted

                                  - 6 -



compensation          under    Section      163A,       is    debarred        from

proceeding with any further claims on the basis of fault

liability in terms of 
Section 166
. After considering the

scheme envisaged by 
Section 163A
 of the Act, it is held

in the said case that Parliament intended to lay down a

comprehensive         scheme       for    the       purpose    of     grant     of

adequate compensation to a section of victims who would

require the amount of compensation without fighting any

protracted litigation. What is ruled therein is that the

compensation determined                and paid under 
Section 163A
 of

the Act is final and not an interim one. The clear

proposition of law which emerges from the decision of

this Court in Deepal G. Soni (supra)                    is that the remedy

for payment of compensation both under Sections 163A and


166
     being      final    and    independent         of     each    other     as

statutorily        provided,       a     claimant      cannot        pursue    his

remedies thereunder simultaneously. As explained by this

Court    in     the    said    decision,        a    claimant,       thus,    must

opt/elect to go either for a proceeding under Section

163A or under 
Section 166
 of the Act, but not under

both.



              Applying the principle laid down in Deepal Soni

(supra)       to   the     facts    of the case, it will have to be

                               - 7 -



held that the respondents having obtained compensation,

finally determined under 
Section 163A
 of the Act are

precluded      from     proceeding       further       with    the     petition

filed    under    
Section      166
       of    the    Act.    The    exception

mentioned by the learned Single Judge in the impugned

judgment that a petition under 
Section 166
 of the Act

can be proceeded further if it is filed before passing

of an award passed under 
Section 163A
 of the Act is not

supported by the scheme envisaged under 
Sections 163A


and 
166
 of the Act and is contrary to the principle of

law   laid     down     by   this   Court      in    Deepal    Soni's       case.

Therefore,       this     Court     is    of    the    opinion       that    the

impugned judgment of the High Court upholding the order

passed    by   the      Tribunal    to    permit      the     respondents      to

proceed further with the petition filed under 
Section

166
 of the Act cannot be sustained and will have to be

set aside.



             For the foregoing reasons, the appeal succeeds.

The order of the Tribunal dated 23.12.2005 allowing the

respondents to proceed with the petition filed under

Section    166    of     the   Motor     Vehicles      Act,     1988    on    the

certain      terms     and conditions mentioned therein and the

                      - 8 -



impugned judgment of the High Court upholding order of

the Tribunal are hereby set aside.



         The appeal accordingly stands disposed of
