                              IN THE SUPREME COURT OF INDIA
                  CRIMINAL APPELLATE JURISDICTION

                  CRIMINAL APPEAL NO. 101 OF 2011
             [ARISING OUT OF SLP(CRL.)NO. 8403 OF 2010]

 RAJESH KUMAR @ KHANNA                   .....            APPELLANT

                                  VERSUS

 STATE OF HARYANA                        .....            RESPONDENT



                                O R D E R



                                  Leave granted.

       We   had   issued   notice   in   this   matter   confined 

only to the question of sentence.  


       We   see   from   the   record   that   the   appellant   has 

undergone 13 months of the sentence imposed on him for 

offences   punishable   under   
Section   325
   of   the   Indian 

Penal Code.  



       In   view   of   the   above,   facts,   we   feel   that   the 

ends   of   justice   would   be   met   if   the   sentence   is 

reduced   to  that   already  undergone   by  him.     With   this 

modification   in   the   sentence,   the   appeal   stands 

dismissed.   The appellant shall be released forthwith 

if not required in connection with any other case.
