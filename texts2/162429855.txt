                    IN THE SUPREME COURT OF INDIA

                    CIVIL APPELLATE JURISDICTION

                CIVIL APPEAL NO(s). 984 OF 2006


RAJENDRA PRASAD GUPTA                                      Appellant (s)

                                 VERSUS

PRAKASH CHANDRA MISHRA & ORS.                              Respondent(s)


                             O    R   D    E   R


       Heard learned counsel for the appellant and respondent

Nos. 1 to 3.    No one appeared for respondent No. 4.


       This Appeal, by special leave, has been filed against

the impugned judgment of the High Court of Allahabad dated

06.02.2004 passed in FAFO No.2103/2003.


       It appears that the appellant was the plaintiff in

Suit   No.   1301   of    1997   before     the    Court   of   Civil   Judge

(Junior Division) Varanasi.               He filed an application to

withdraw the said suit.           Subsequently, it appears that he

changed his mind and before an order could be passed in the

withdrawal application he filed an application praying for

withdrawal     of   the    earlier        withdrawal   application.      The

second application had been dismissed and that order was

upheld by the High Court. Hence, this appeal by special

leave.



                                      :1:

      The   High     Court    was   of      the    view   that    once     the

application for withdrawal of the suit is filed the suit

stands dismissed as withdrawn even without any order on the

withdrawal application. Hence, the second application was

not maintainable.         We do not agree.



      Rules of procedure are handmaids of justice.                    
Section

151
 of the Code of Civil Procedure gives inherent powers to

the     court   to   do    justice.      That     provision     has   to   be

interpreted to mean that every procedure is permitted to

the court for doing justice unless expressly prohibited,

and not that every procedure is prohibited unless expressly

permitted. There is no express bar in filing an application

for withdrawal of the withdrawal application.


      In Narsingh Das v. Mangal Dubey, ILR 5 All 163 (FB)

(1882), Mr. Justice Mahmood, the celebrated Judge of the

Allahabad High Court, observed :-



            "Courts are not to act upon the
            principle that every procedure is to be
            taken   as   prohibited  unless   it   is
            expressly provided for by the Code, but
            on the converse principle that every
            procedure   is   to   be  understood   as
            permissible till it is shown to be
            prohibited by the law. As a matter of
            general principle prohibition      cannot
            be presumed."

 
The above view was followed by a Full Bench of the

Allahabad High Court in 
Raj Narain Saxena                 Vs.    Bhim Sen &

others
, AIR 1966 Allahabad 84 FB, and we agree with this

view.




                                      :2:

     Accordingly,   we    are     of   the   opinion     that   the

application   praying    for    withdrawal   of   the   withdrawal

application was maintainable. We order accordingly.


     In the result, the impugned judgment of the High Court

is set aside and the Appeal is allowed.      No costs.


     The suit shall proceed and to be decided on merits,

expeditiously .
