                  IN THE SUPREME COURT OF INDIA


                   CIVIL APPELLATE JURISDICTION


                    CIVIL APPEAL NO.804 OF 2011
            [Arising out of SLP [C] No.8419 of 2009]




U.G.Hospitals Pvt. Ltd.                         ... Appellant


Vs.


State of Haryana & Ors.                         ... Respondents




                              O R D E R



       Leave granted. Heard.



2.     Haryana   Urban   Development   Authority   (`HUDA'   for 


short),   the   second   respondent   herein,   issued   an 


advertisement   in   the   newspapers   dated   14th  and   15th  June, 


2005,   inviting   applications   for   allotment   of   a   hospital 


plot   measuring   12   acres   in   Sector   23A,   Gurgaon,   and   a 


hospital   plot   measuring   8.3   Acres   in   Sector   51,   Gurgaon, 


from persons interested on or before 29.6.2005. In response 


to   the   said   advertisement,   the   appellant   applied   for   the 


hospital   plot   in   Sector   51   on   28.6.2005.   The   fifth 


respondent applied on 15.6.2005 (said to have been received 


by   the   HUDA   on   27.6.2005)   for   allotment   of   the   hospital 


plot in Sector 23A, stating that if they were not allotted 



                                     2





the plot in Sector 23A, their application may be considered 


for allotment of the plot in Sector 51.



3.    By   re-advertisement   dated   7.7.2005,   the   last   date   for 


submission of applications was extended upto 20.7.2005 with 


a   clarification   that   those   who   had   applied   earlier   in 


response   to   the   advertisement   dated   14/15.6.2005   need   not 


apply   again.   The   fifth   respondent   gave   a   letter   dated 


18.7.2005 to HUDA stating that on physical verification it 


was   found  that   the  plot   in  Sector   23A  was   only  8.66   acres 


and   not   12   acres   and   there   was   also   some   difficulties   in 


regard   to   use   of   the   entire   plot   for   construction   and 


therefore,   their   application   may   be   considered   for 


allotment of the plot in Sector 51.



4.    Both   the   advertisements   required   the   applicants   to 


apply   for   allotment   in   the   form   prescribed   in   the 


advertisements.   While   the   application   of   fifth   respondent 


dated   15.6.2005   for   the   plot   in   Sector   23A   was   in   the 


prescribed   form,   the   subsequent   letter   dated   18.7.2005 


seeking   allotment   of   the   plot   in   Sector   51   was   not   an 


application in the prescribed form, but was only a request 


letter.   After   considering   the   applications,   HUDA   allotted 



                                     3





the   plot   at   Sector   51   to   the   fifth   respondent.   The 


appellant was not allotted any plot. The plot at Sector 23A 


was not allotted to any one.



5.    In   pursuance   of   such   allotment,   the   fifth   respondent 


obtained   sanction   of   a   building   plan   on   25.4.2006   and 


completed   the   construction   of   hospital   building   in   July, 


2007. A deed of conveyance dated 19.7.2007 was executed in 


favour   of   the   fifth   respondent   in   regard   to   the   plot   at 


Sector 51. The fifth respondent's hospital is stated to be 


functioning in the plot at Sector 51, from 2007 itself.



6.    In   April,   2007,   the   appellant   filed   a   writ   petition 


for quashing the allotment letter dated 27.9.2005 issued in 


favour   of   the   fifth   respondent   in   regard   to   allotment   of 


the   hospital   plot   at   Sector   51   and   seeking   a   direction   to 


the HUDA and the State to allot the said plot at Sector 51 


in its favour. Alternatively the appellant prayed that the 


vacant   hospital   plot   at   Sector   23A   may   be   allotted   to   it. 



The   said   writ   petition   was   dismissed   by   the   High   Court   by 


impugned   order   dated   1.12.2008,   on   the   ground   that   there 


was   considerable   delay   in   filing   the   writ   petition 


challenging   the   allotment   in   favour   of   the   fifth 


respondent.   The   High   Court   also   found   that   there   was   no 



                                     4





irregularity   in   allotting   the   plot   in   Sector   51   to   the 


fifth   respondent.   It   held   that   the   appellant   who   had 


participated   in   the   process   of   allotment   without 


questioning the same, could not challenge the allotment in 


favour   of   the   fifth   respondent.   The   said   order   is 


challenged in this appeal by special leave. 



7.    The   appellant   contends   that   the   application   for 


allotment   by   the   fifth   respondent   was   in   regard   to   the 


hospital   plot   in   Sector   23A   and   the   letter   given   on 


18.7.2005   could   not   be   considered   as   an   application   for 


allotment of plot at Sector 51. It was submitted that HUDA 


ought   to   have   allotted   the   plot   at   Sector   23A   to   fifth 


respondent   and   plot   at   Sector   51   to   the   appellant   as   per 


their   respective   applications.   It   was   contended   that   by 


allotting   the   plot   at   Sector   51   to   fifth   respondent   even 


though its application was for allotment of plot at Sector 


23A,   HUDA   committed   an   irregularity,   thereby   denying   the 


appellant to its legitimate claim for allotment of a plot. 



It   is   further   contended   that   when   the   application   in   the 


prescribed   form   by   fifth   respondent   was   for   allotment   of 


plot   at   Sector   23A,   there   was   no   justification   for 


allotting the plot at Sector 51 to fifth respondent. It was 



                                            5





submitted         that         the          appellant         fulfilled             the 


eligibility/preference                criteria         specified         in         the 


advertisement for allotment of the plot.  



8.    Learned counsel for the State and HUDA submitted that 


a   fresh   advertisement   was   issued   in   the   newspapers   on 


7.7.2005   extending   the   date   for   making   applications   till 


20.7.2005   and   the   application   dated   18.7.2005   given   by 


fifth respondent sought allotment of the plot in Sector 51 


and therefore the fifth respondent was an applicant for the 


plot at Sector 51 also. The fifth respondent submitted that 


it   had   applied   for   the   alternative   plot,   that   is   plot   at 


Sector 51 in pursuance to the re-advertisement on 7.7.2005 


and therefore the allotment was legal.



9.    Even   though   the   application   of   fifth   respondent   for 


the   plot  at   Sector  51   was  not   in  the   prescribed  form,   the 


allotment   was   made   as   long   back   as   on   27.9.2005   and   the 


fifth   respondent   has   constructed   and   running   the   hospital 


even from 2007. The appellant filed the writ petition only 


on   2.4.2007,   nearly   one   and   a   half   years   after   the 


allotment.   In   the   circumstances,   the   High   Court   was 


justified   in   not   interfering   with   the   allotment   that   was 



                                      6





made   to   the   fifth   respondent.   We   find   no   reason   to 


interfere with the decision of the High Court. 



10.    At   this   stage   the   learned   counsel   for   the   appellant 


submitted   that   though   there   were   several   applications, 


ultimately,   all   other   applications   were   withdrawn,   and 


there   were   only   two   applications   for   the   two   plots,   that 


is,   appellant   for   hospital   plot   at   Sector   51   and   fifth 


respondent for hospital plot at Sector 23A. Learned counsel 


for   the   appellant   submitted   that   the   plot   at   Sector   51 


having been allotted to the fifth respondent, HUDA ought to 


have at least allotted the plot at Sector 23A to appellant. 



The   appellant   submitted   that   it   was   ready   and   willing   to 


accept   the   plot   at   Sector   23A   on   `as   is   where   is   basis', 


irrespective   of   the   site   condition.   It   is   also   submitted 


that   the   alternative   prayer   for   allotment   of   the   plot   at 


Sector 23A made in the writ petition, was not considered by 


the High Court.  



11.    Having regard to the fact that the appellant had made 


a   valid   application   for   allotment   and   it   was   improperly 


rejected on account of HUDA allotting the plot applied for 


by   the   appellant   to   the   fifth   respondent   (even   though   its 


application   was   for   a   different   plot),   HUDA   may   consider 



                                       7





the request of the appellant for allotment of the hospital 


plot   at   Sector   23A   on   such   terms   as   it   deems   fit,   as   per 


its rules and regulations in accordance with law. 



12.    With the said observations, this appeal is disposed of.
