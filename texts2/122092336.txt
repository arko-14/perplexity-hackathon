            We have heard learned counsel for the parties.
            Both  the appellants  have undergone  more than  one year  of 

sentence.     On   consideration   of   the   totality   of   the   facts   and 

circumstances   of   this   case,   we   are   of   the   considered   opinion   that 

interest of justice would be met if the appellants are released on 

the sentence already undergone.   Both the appellants undertakes to 

pay a sum of Rs.50,000/- each to the Complainant-Sadhu Singh within 

four weeks from today and submit compliance to this Court by way of 

an affidavit.





            The appeal is disposed of accordingly.
