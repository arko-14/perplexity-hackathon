Singhvi 1 IN THE SUPREME COURT OF INDIA CIVIL APPELLATE JURISDICTION CIVIL APPEAL NO(s).1894 OF 2011 (Arising out of SLP(C) No.7350/2007) STATE OF UTTARAKHAND AND OTHERS ...Appellant(s) VERSUS HARPAL SINGH RAWAT ...Respondent(s) J U D G M E N T Delay condoned. Leave granted. What should be the stamp duty payable on lease agreement executed between appellant No.1 and the respondent entitling the latter to collect toll tax is the question which arises for consideration in this appeal filed against the order passed by the Division Bench of the Uttarakhand High Court whereby the writ petition filed by the respondent was disposed of in terms of the judgments of the Allahabad High Court in Tejveer Singh v. State of Uttar Pradesh 1997 (29) ALR 687 and the Uttarakhand High Court in Writ Petition No.1020 of 2004 (M/B) - Naresh Agarwal v. State of Uttaranchal. The respondent participated in the auction held by 2 Executive Engineer, Construction Division, PWD, Haldwani (appellant No.2 herein) for grant on lease collection of toll tax for using Haldwani Bye-Pass Road, 14 K.M. (Kathgodam) Gaula bridge. The bid of Rs.22 lakhs given by the respondent was accepted by the competent authority. Thereafter, lease agreement dated 24.3.2006 was executed between the Governor of Uttaranchal (now Uttarakhand) through Commissioner, Kumaon Division and the respondent whereby the latter was given exclusive right to collect toll from the vehicles using the road and Gaula bridge. As a condition for execution of lease, communication dated 25.2.2006 was sent by appellant No.2 to the respondent requiring him to deposit stamp duty of Rs.2,20,400/-. However, instead of depositing the stamp duty, the respondent filed Writ Petition No.204(M/B) of 2006 for quashing the notice issued by appellant No.2 and also for issue of a direction to the appellants to charge stamp duty in accordance with the judgments in Tejveer Sing 's case and Naresh Agarwal's case by asserting that the contract executed between the parties was only a security bond and stamp duty was payable as per Article 57 of Schedule I-B of Indian Stamp Act, 1899 (for short, `the Act'), as amended by the State of U.P. and as applicable to the State of Uttarakhand. The Division Bench of the High Court disposed of the writ 3 petition by recording a cryptic order, which reads thus: ""By means of this writ petition, the petitioner has prayed for writ of certiorari quashing the order dated 25.2.2006 (Annexure No.2) passed by Respondent no.2 and further a writ of mandamus commanding the respondent not to demand/realize stamp duty on the earnest money/security deposit the money of contract as demanded on the basis of the Government instructions and the respondents may be directed to demand stamp duty in pursuance of the direction in the case of Tejveer Singh Vs. State of U.P. and others reported in 1997 (29) ALR Page 687 as well as judgment passed by this Hon'ble Court in Writ Petition No.1020/2004 (M/B), Naresh Agarwal Vs. State of Uttaranchal. 2.A Division Bench of this Court has also followed the aforesaid judgment, which is referred in the prayer clause of the present writ petition. The controversy raised in the writ petition is squarely covered by the aforementioned judgment as submitted by learned Addl. Chief Standing Counsel. Therefore, the writ petition is disposed of in terms of the aforementioned judgment of Hon'ble Allahabad High Court."" Learned counsel for the appellants invited our attention to the contents of lease agreement dated 24.3.2006 to show that the respondent was given exclusive right to collect the toll from 31.3.2006 to 30.3.2007 against the consideration of Rs.22 lacs and argued that stamp duty on such lease is payable under Article 35 of Schedule I-B of the Act and not under Article 57 thereof. In support of this argument, the learned counsel relied upon judgments of the Special Bench of the Allahabad High Court in Banney Khan versus Chief Inspector of Stamp, U.P. 4 AIR 1976 Allahabad 475 and a Division Bench of the Andhra Pradesh High Court in Uppalapati Durga Prasad and others versus Executive Engineer (R&B) N.H. Division, Srikakulam and others 2001 (4) ALT 228. Learned counsel then submitted that stamp duty was demanded from the respondent keeping in view the terms of the lease agreement, which enabled him to collect toll tax and not on the security given by him for due performance of the contract and the Division Bench of the High Court committed serious error by disposing of the writ petition in terms of the judgments in Tejveer Singh 's case and Naresh Agarwal's case. We have considered the argument/submission of the learned counsel. Section 2(16)(c) , Articles 35(b) and 57 of Schedule I-B of the Act , which have bearing on the decision of this case read as under: ""2.(16)'Lease' means a lease of immovable property, and includes also- (a) a patta; (b) a kabuliyat or other undertaking in writing, not being a counterpart of a lease, to cultivate, occupy or pay or deliver or pay or deliver rent for immovable property; (c) any instrument by which tolls of any description are let; (d) any writing on an application for lease intended to signify that the application is granted; (e) any instrument by which mining lease is granted in respect of minor minerals as defined in clause (e) of Section 3 of the Mines and Minerals (Regulation and Development) Act, 1957; 5 Schedule I-B 35. Lease, including an under-lease or sublease and any agreement to let or sublet- (b) where the lease is granted for a fine or premium or for money advanced and where no rent is reserved.- (i) where the lease The same duty as a purports to be for a Conveyance [No.23 term not exceeding clause (a)], for thirty years; consideration equal to the amount or value of such fine or premium or advance as set forth in the lease. (ii) where the lease The same duty as a purports to be for a Conveyance [No.23 term exceeding thirty clause (a)]. for a years; consideration equal to the market value of the property which is subject of the lease. 6 57. Security Bond or Mortgage-deed executed by way of security for the due execution of an office, or to account for money or other property received by virtue thereof, or executed by a surety to secure the due performance of a contract or the due discharge of a liability - (a) xx xx xx xx xx xx (b) in any other case One hundred rupees. xx xx xx (a) xx xx xx xx xx xx (b) xx xx xx xx xx xx (c) xx xx xx xx xx xx (d) xx xx xx xx xx xx (e) xx xx xx xx xx xx The definition of `lease' contained in Section 2(16) consists of two parts. The first part is applicable to any lease with respect to immovable property. The second part, which is inclusive, applies to various kinds of instruments by which a title, or other rights may be conferred upon the lessee for a specified period in respect of immovable property or otherwise. The use of the words ""includes also"" implies that the definition of lease contained in Section 2(16)(c) is very 7 wide and even if the transaction does not amount to a lease under Section 105 of the Transfer of Property Act, the same may nonetheless be a lease for the purpose of the Act. The acceptance of the argument made on behalf of the appellants will largely depend on the contents of auction notice dated 27.10.2005 issued by appellant No.2 and the lease agreement executed between the parties, the relevant portions of which are extracted below: ""AUCTION NOTICE This is for the information of the general public that a public auction will be held in Janpad Nainital under construction Division, Public Works Department by the undersigned or its authorised representative in the office premises on 9.12.2005 at 12.00 for giving on lease collection of toll tax for using Haldwani Bye- Pass Road, 14 K.M.

Lessor through this lease gives the exclusive right to collect the toll from all those vehicles whether 9 rented or on rent ""which are described in Schedule and not exempted of toll but with the condition that lessor will have the right to have the control of said bridge and its existing places and to run upto the extent of any period. That if in respect of any serious situation in relation to public service or specific need arise, only such officer will be deciding authority who works on behalf of lessor because of this it was necessary for him to do that and for which the compensation amount have to be paid by Uttaranchal Govt., as by Govt. may issue order in each case for utilizing for this. Said lessee will have the said right from the midnight 12' O clock of 31.3.2006 to 31.03.2007 against consideration of Rs.22,00,000/- [Twenty two lakhs] annual rent in monthly installments without any deduction in the office of Executive Enginner of concerned division as prescribed in clause-I of schedule enclosed with this lease......... Schedule-1 Rs.22,00,000/- which has been reserved through this lease will be paid by lessee in twelve monthly installments on first date of each month as per the details given below:- Name of Month Due Date Amount April, 2006 01.04.2006 Rs.183300/- May, 2006 01.05.2006 Rs.183300/- June, 2006 01.06.2006 Rs.183300/- July, 2006 01.07.2006 Rs.183300/- August, 2006 01.08.2006 Rs.183300/- September, 2006 01.09.2006 Rs.183300/- October, 2006 01.10.2006 Rs.183300/- November, 2006 01.11.2006 Rs.183300/- December, 2006 01.12.2006 Rs.183300/- January, 2007 01.01.2007 Rs.183300/- 10 February, 2007 01.02.2007 Rs.183300/- March, 2007 01.03.2007 Rs.183700/- 2. The Lessee will deposit the amount equal to three monthly installment with the Executive Engineer of Construction Division, P.W.D., Haldwani, hereinafter will be called as Executive Engineer and Executive Engineer will keep this amount with him as partial security for fulfilling and compliance of terms and conditions of agreement prescribed in schedule and out of which he can take such amount as rent which becomes due and payable or can deduct such amounts of penalties from that which may be imposed upon lessee and provision of which has been made hereinafter."" A conjoint reading of the auction notice and the lease agreement makes it clear that tenders were invited from the public for grant on lease collection of toll tax for using Haldwani Bye-Pass Road 14 K.M. (Kathgodam) Gaula bridge and highest bid of Rs.22 lakhs given by the respondent was accepted by the competent authority. The monthly amount payable by the respondent was lease money and not a security for due performance of the contract. Such an agreement clearly falls within the ambit of the term ""lease"" as defined in Section 2(16)(c) read with Article 35(b) of Schedule I-B and not under Article 57 of Schedule I-B, which gets attracted only when a security bond or mortgage deed is executed for due execution of an office or to account for money or other property received by virtue thereof or for due performance of a contract or the due 11 discharge of a liability. Therefore, the demand of stamp duty of Rs.2,20,400/- from the respondent cannot be termed as illegal. In Banney Khan 's case, the Special Bench of the Allahabad High Court was called upon to consider whether the lease executed between Municipal Board, Ujhani and the appellant authorising the latter to collect toll from the premises known as ""New Sabzimandi"" was a lease falling under Section 2(16) of the Act was chargeable under Article 35(b) of Schedule I-B. The Special Bench referred to the definition of lease, the judgments of the Full Bench in Burmah Shell Oil Storage and Distributing Co. Ltd. of India AIR 1933 All 735 and the Andhra Pradesh High Court in Panchayat Samiti v. Smt. Kethavarapu Kanamma AIR 1973 AP 72 and observed: ""................A casual reading of the definition of ""lease"" indicates that any instrument by which tolls of any description are let comes within the definition of this term. What is, therefore, to be seen is whether the document is an instrument by which tolls of any description are let. In our opinion the agreement before us comes clearly within the language quoted above. This is a document by which all lands and buildings known as ""New Subzi Mandi"" have been made over by the owners thereof to the applicant for a period of one year. He is entitled to realise fee from occupiers thereof at certain rates in consideration of a sum fixed by public auction. This ""letting of tolls"" and the document is covered by Section 2(16)(c) of the Stamp Act. It is needless to say that the word ""toll"" used in 12 this sub-section means any sum of money which is taken in respect of some benefit, the benefit being the temporary use of land, that is, fares and market tolls. It includes all payments or taxes made by persons who frequent the market for the sale of any commodity or any thing which by practice or custom is expected to be sold in the market. This document is signed both by the lessor and the lessee. Therefore, it can hardly be doubted that it is an instrument by which collection of tolls is let and is lease within the meaning of Section 2(16) of the Stamp Act and is chargeable with Stamp duty under Article 35(b) Schedule I-B of the U.P. Stamp (Amendment) Act, 1962............."" In Uppalapati Durga Prasad v. Executive Engineer (R&B ) (supra), a Division Bench of the Andhra Pradesh High Court considered a similar question in the context of an agreement signed by the parties in the matter of collection of toll. While rejecting the argument of the writ petitioner that he was not liable to pay stamp duty under Article 35(b) read with Section 2(16) of the Act, the Division Bench observed: ""On bare reading of the section it becomes clear that all leases with respect to immovable property would be leases in terms of Section 2(16) but in addition to leases of immovable property in other three categories there would also be lease under category (c) in which any instrument by which tolls of any description are let would be a lease for the purpose of Section 2(16) . The instrument by which right to collect toll is conveyed has to be treated as lease for the purposes of Stamp Act . Right to collect toll will never in any circumstances involve immovable property. Basically toll is collected for using a road or bridge and as such neither the road nor the bridge is leased out, only the right to collection is 13 leased out and this right of leasing out the collection is 'lease' for the purposes of Stamp Act ............."" In our view, the aforementioned judgments of the Allahabad and Andhra Pradesh High Courts represents the correct legal position on the applicability of Article 35(b) of Schedule I-B of the Act . In Tejveer Singh 's case, the Division Bench of the Allahabad High Court considered the question whether the amount offered as security for due performance of the contract for construction of drains culvert etc., is chargeable under Article 57 of Schedule I-B. The Division Bench relied upon the judgment of Special Bench in M/s. Hindustan Sugar Mills Limited v. State of U.P. AIR 1972 Allahabad 8 and of this Court in Board of Revenue v. A.M. Ansari (1976) 3 SCC 512 and held that the stamp duty on such agreement is to be paid under Article 57 of Schedule I-B of the Act , as amended by the State of Uttar Pradesh. The judgment in Tejveer Singh 's case was followed by the Division Bench of the Uttarakhand High Court in the case of Naresh Agarwal. These two judgments have no bearing on the issue raised in the writ petition filed by the respondent. Therefore, it must be held that the Division Bench of the High Court committed serious error by disposing of the writ petition of the respondent by relying upon the judgments in Tejveer 14 Singh 's case and Naresh Agarwal's case, and that too, without even adverting to the lease agreement executed between appellant No.1 and the respondent. In the result, the appeal is allowed, the impugned order is set aside and the writ petition filed by the respondent is dismissed. The appellants shall now be free to recover stamp duty from the respondent in terms of Notice No.775 dated 25.2.2006. Since no one has appeared on behalf of the respondent, the costs are made easy. ........................J. (G.S. SINGHVI) ........................J.

Supreme Court of India Chairman & M.D.,Indian Overseas ... vs Tribhuwan Nath Srivastava on 4 February, 2011 Author: Aftab Alam Bench: R.M. Lodha , Aftab Alam REPORTABLE IN THE SUPREME COURT OF INDIA CIVIL APPELLATE JURISDICTION CIVIL APPEAL NO.1186 OF 2005 Chairman and M.D. Indian Overseas Bank & Ors. ... Appellants Versus Tribhuwan Nath Srivastava ... Respondent J U D G M E N T AFTAB ALAM, J. 1. This appeal by special leave is directed against the judgment and order dated September 3, 2003 passed by a division bench of the Allahabad High Court on a writ petition (Civil Miscellaneous Writ Petition No.6162 of 2003) filed by the respondent who was at that time working as an officer in the appellant-bank. The High Court allowed the writ petition filed by the respondent, quashed the decision of the bank rejecting his application for 2 voluntary retirement under the bank's scheme and directed the appellant-bank to accept his application for voluntary retirement forthwith. 2. This Court while granting special leave to appeal, by order dated February 11, 2005, stayed the operation of the order of the High Court coming under appeal. As a result, the respondent continued in service and eventually retired on reaching the age of superannuation on June 6, 2009. He has been paid his terminal dues and is also getting regularly his monthly pension. In view of this material change in circumstances during the pendency of the appeal, we suggested that the parties should negotiate and try to come to some amicable settlement. They were, however, unable to come to terms and the respondent insisted that the appeal be heard on merits and in case it is finally dismissed, then, the Court may consider how to appropriately mould the relief in his favour. We, accordingly, proceeded to examine the respondent's claim for grant of voluntary retirement under the scheme of the bank on merits. 3. In order to examine the case of the rival sides in perspective, it would be useful to briefly state the relevant facts. The board of directors of the appellant-bank in its meeting held on November 25, 2000 approved a voluntary retirement scheme for the officers and employees of the bank, called the IOB Officers/Employees Voluntary Retirement Scheme - 2000 3 (""the scheme"" for short). The object of the scheme was ""to adopt measures to have optimum human resources at various levels in keeping with the business strategies, skill profile to achieve balanced age and requirement of the bank."" The scheme remained in operation for 5 weeks from December 15, 2000 to January 19, 2001. 4. The eligibility to apply for voluntary retirement under the scheme was laid down in Clause 4. Clause 4.1 provided that all permanent employees with 15 years of service or 40 years of age would be eligible to apply for voluntary retirement under the scheme. Clause 4.2 enumerated the six categories (from sub-clauses `a' to `f') that would not be eligible to seek voluntary retirement under the scheme. Under the heading `General Conditions' it was stated, in paragraph 4, that depending upon the requirement of the bank, the competent authority would have absolute discretion, subject to recording the reasons for the decision, either to accept or reject the request of an officer/employee seeking voluntary retirement under the scheme. Paragraph 10 provided that the cases of officers/employees opting for voluntary retirement under the scheme against whom disciplinary proceedings were contemplated would be considered by the respective disciplinary authorities having regard to the facts of each case before forwarding the request of such officers/employees to the competent 4 authority. Under the heading `Clarifications' (in Annexure II to the Scheme), it was stated, in paragraph 2, that disciplinary proceedings would be deemed to be pending for the purpose of VRS, if the member had been placed under suspension or any notice had been issued to him to show cause why disciplinary proceedings should not be instituted against him and would be deemed to be pending until final orders were passed by the disciplinary authority. 5. On December 15, 2000, the respondent made an application seeking voluntary retirement from the service of the bank under the scheme. At that time, the respondent was working as Chief Manager (in Scale IV), Indian Overseas Bank, Allahabad. It is not disputed that he was quite eligible for making the application in that he was a permanent employee with more than 15 years of service and was over 40 years of age. Nevertheless, the bank did not accept his request and intimated him by letter dated February 21, 2001 that ""the Competent Authority has decided not to accept his application considering (the) business/organizational requirements and administrative exigencies of the bank"". 6. The respondent challenged the decision of the bank communicated to him vide letter dated February 21, 2001 in a Writ Petition (CMWP No.4167 of 2001) before the Allahabad High Court. In the supplementary counter 5 affidavit filed in the case on behalf of the bank, it was stated that in Scale IV, to which the respondent belonged, there were 187 posts out of which 80 persons had applied for VRS under the scheme. The management accepted the applications of only 22 officers and the rest of the applications were rejected taking into account the various considerations, and the merits and demerits of the officers. In paragraph 6 of the supplementary counter affidavit, it was asserted that it was purely within the discretion of the bank to accept or not to accept the application of any particular officer for grant of voluntary retirement under the scheme. The High Court took exception to the stand of the bank that the matter lay purely within the discretion of the competent authority and criticised it as opposed to the mandate of Article 14 of the Constitution. The High Court also took the view that the words ""taking into account the various considerations and merits and demerits of the officers"" provided a very vague basis to decide whether or not to accept the application for VRS made by different officers. It also noted the allegations made on behalf of the respondent that the bank had allowed voluntary retirement even to officers against whom disciplinary proceedings were pending or contemplated and who, therefore, were not eligible under the scheme. It, accordingly, allowed the respondent's writ petition by judgment and order dated November 27, 2002 holding that the bank had 6 acted arbitrarily in his case and had rejected his application without according good reasons. The High Court quashed the order dated February 21, 2001 and directed the bank to reconsider the matter in light of the observations made by it and take a fresh decision, on the respondent's application for grant of VRS in accordance with the law and the scheme, within 6 weeks from the date of production of a certified copy of its order. 7. The respondent submitted a copy of the High Court order to the bank along with his representation dated December 7, 2002 whereupon the board of directors of the bank in its meeting held on January 11, 2003 constituted a committee consisting of the Chairman and Managing Director, the Executive Director and the General Manager (Personnel) to reconsider his request for voluntary retirement as directed by the High Court. The Committee in its meeting held on January 11, 2003 reconsidered the matter in great detail, taking into account the service record of the respondent. The Committee noted that the respondent was an agricultural engineering graduate and was appointed as a clerk in the bank on October 26, 1970. For his sincere and hard work, he was promoted as officer in Junior Management Grade Scale I on June 1, 1975, within 5 years of his appointment as clerk. His performance in the post was exemplary. The bank, therefore, decided to utilize his services abroad and posted him to the Hong Kong branch. Ordinarily, 7 overseas assignments are given to Middle Management Grade Officers in Scale II and above but in the case of the respondent, who was at that time an officer in the Junior Management Grade I, he was given the assignment in view of his dedicated work and educational background. Even while serving abroad he was promoted to Middle Management Grade Scale II on July 1, 1982. After completing foreign assignment for a term, he was posted to the Lucknow region in August, 1982 and his services were utilized at the Varanasi Cantonment and Lucknow Branches. While working at Lucknow, the respondent was able to canvass a good number of deposit accounts and provided satisfactory customer service which earned him appreciation from the Zonal Manager. In view of his rich experience in Lucknow, the bank elevated him in position and posted him as Senior Manager in the Kankhal branch, which was selected by the Bank Management as the best branch during his tenure. The Committee further noted that considering his potential and ability the bank provided him various in-house and external trainings. He was promoted to the Middle Management Grade III during 1992 and further promoted to the Senior Management Grade Scale IV in the year 1998. His services were well utilized not only to core banking but also in specialized areas like foreign exchange, overseas trading, etc. and he had a track record of unblemished service. He had scored good ratings in all 8 confidential reports. He had been given good exposure including foreign postings and had a lot of potential. Therefore, the bank did not want to lose the benefit of his services. The Committee concluded that keeping in view the past track record, the specialized skill expertise, potential, training imparted, organizational requirement and administrative exigencies, the services of the respondent were required for the development of the bank and hence, resolved not to accept the voluntary retirement application under the scheme. The decision of the Committee was communicated to the respondent who once again challenged it before the High Court in Civil Miscellaneous Writ Petition No.6162 of 2003. 8. In the second round of litigation, the appellant-bank, while resisting the writ petition filed by the respondent before the High Court on merits, once again referred to paragraph 4 of the General Conditions of the scheme, taking the stand that the acceptance or rejection of the request for voluntary retirement under the scheme lay within the absolute discretion of the competent authority. 9. The rejection of the respondent's application for voluntary retirement by the bank for the second time and the reiteration that the matter was within the absolute discretion of the competent authority, seems to have offended the High Court and it wrote a rather angry judgment. The High Court 9 observed that the bank and its officers had acted in a highly arbitrary, discriminatory and malafide manner and had not shown any respect to the High Court by totally flouting its earlier judgment. It further said that despite the clear observation in its earlier judgment, the bank authorities had again ""dared"" to take the stand that it was the absolute discretion of the competent authority either to accept or reject the application. The court went on to say that the Chief Regional Manager of the bank who had filed the counter affidavit had absolutely no respect for the High Court and further that the court was at first inclined to issue a notice of contempt to him for invoking the absolute discretion of the competent authority which, according to the High Court, amounted to grossly contemptuous averments. The High Court, however, refrained from issuing any contempt notice assuming in his favour that he was probably not able to understand what he said in the affidavit. Adverting to the merits of the case, the court accepted the respondent's allegations that even while his request was turned down many officers who were not eligible were granted voluntary retirement under the scheme. The court held that the bank authorities had adopted a `pick and choose' policy in accepting and rejecting the applications made by different officers/employees for grant of voluntary requirement. The High Court in its judgment (at page 19 of the SLP paper book) gave a list of employees, who, 10 according to the respondent, were allowed voluntary retirement even though they were charge-sheeted or given show cause notice in contemplation of disciplinary proceedings and who were, therefore, ineligible in terms of Clause 4.2(c) of the scheme. The High Court gave another list of officers/employees (at page 20 of the SLP paper book) who, according to the respondent, were granted voluntary retirement even though they were given specialized training in the area of credit and foreign exchange and were, for that reason, ineligible in terms of clause 4.2(e) of the scheme. The High Court observed that the bank acted in a highly arbitrary and discriminatory manner by allowing voluntary retirement to officers/employees who were ineligible under the scheme and on the other hand denying it to the respondent who according to its own showing had a sterling record. In this connection, the High Court made the following observation: ""In our opinion the petitioner is fully eligible for VRS, 2000, and his application has been rejected arbitrarily and has been discriminated again. He has also been unnecessarily harassed by the respondents, as stated in para 18 of the petition by first transferring him to Chennai during the pendency of his writ petition and then posting him under an officer 3 years his junior. The respondents themselves have admitted that the petitioner has been working with utmost sincerely (sic), honestly and diligence in discharging his duties in the bank. It seems that the policy of the bank is to punish the good, honest and competent officers and to reward those who are not. This, in our opinion, will lead to total demoralization of the good, 11 honest and competent officers and employees of the bank if it is permitted to continue any further. The VRS scheme was floated for giving the benefit to the good officers and not for those who are having a bad service record, but it seems that the Bank in total disregard of the scheme has adopted a policy of pick and choose. Thus merit has in fact become demerit in the Bank. Those who are competent are denied VRS but those having a bad record are being given benefit of the VRS."" (emphasis added) 10. Proceeding thus, the High Court allowed the respondent's writ petition and by judgment and order dated September 3, 2003, set aside the decision of the appellant-bank not to accept the respondent's request for voluntary retirement and observing that any further remand would not serve any useful purpose, the High Court went on to direct the bank to accept the respondent's application for grant of voluntary retirement. 11. Mr. C.U. Singh, learned senior counsel appearing for the appellant-bank submitted that the High Court was in grave error in reviewing the bank's decision on the respondent's application for voluntary retirement as an appellate authority and substituting its own decision for that of the bank. Mr. Singh further submitted that the High Court was equally in error in denying to the competent authority in the bank the absolute discretion for accepting or rejecting the request for voluntary retirement made by an officer of the bank as expressly stipulated in the scheme. 12 Learned counsel asserted that in the matter of voluntary retirement under the scheme, the bank has an absolute discretion to grant or reject the request and the legal position in this regard was settled by this Court. In support of the submission he referred to a decision of this Court in Board of Trustees, Vishakhapatnam Port Trust and Ors. v. T.S.N. Raju and Anr. , (2006) 7 SCC 664, and relied upon the observations made in paragraphs 22, 33 and 34, which are as under: ""22. In our opinion, under the Scheme, the Chairman of the Port Trust has an absolute right either to accept or not to accept the applications filed by the employees for retirement under the voluntary retirement scheme... 33. In our opinion, the Chairman is competent to frame the scheme having regard to the exigencies of work and no one can claim voluntary retirement as of right. The learned Judges of the High Court have also not seen that the respondent's application for voluntary retirement cannot be considered in view of the seniority of service of the employees concerned. 34. In our opinion, the request of the employees seeking voluntary retirement was not to take effect until and unless it was accepted in writing by the Port Trust Authorities. The Port Trust Authorities had the absolute discretion whether to accept or reject the request of the employee seeking voluntary retirement under the scheme. There is no assurance that such an application would be accepted without any consideration. The process of acceptance of an offer made by an employee was in the discretion of the Port Trust. We, therefore, have no hesitation in coming to the conclusion that VRS was not a proposal or an offer but merely an invitation to treat and the applications filed by the employees constituted an offer."" 13 12. The decision relied upon by Mr. Singh evidently supports his contention but the observations made by this Court as quoted above need to be understood in the context of the case. In the case of T.S.N. Raju, the Chairman of the Port Trust made a review on the implementation of the scheme for voluntary retirement and keeping in view the concern expressed by the Secretary, Department of Shipping, Ministry of Surface Transport, Government of India, took the decision that the request for voluntary retirement under the scheme should be considered only in case of employees who were below the age of 58 years. The application of T.S.N. Raju (and another respondent in that case ) came up for consideration after they had crossed the age of 58 years and were accordingly rejected on the basis of the decision of the Chairman. They challenged the action of the Port Trust in rejecting their request for voluntary retirement, taking the plea before the court that the Port Trust had no discretion to reject their request to take retirement under the voluntary retirement scheme except in cases of the exigencies of service or the compelling necessities or the indispensability of the employees concerned. It was to rebut such sweeping assertion of right that this Court made the observation that under the scheme, the Chairman of the Port Trust had the absolute right to accept or not accept the request for voluntary retirement under the scheme. 14 13. The observations made in T.S.N. Raju do not mean that this Court endorsed or approved the discretion vested in the employer (be it the Port Trust or the bank) as absolute in the manner of an unruly horse prancing beyond the control of anyone or anything. In the 62nd year of the Republic, it is rather late in the day for the State or any of the State's agencies or instrumentalities to claim absolute discretion, like the discretion of a despot or a discretion completely divorced from reasonableness. 14. But at the same time, it must also be realized that reasonableness is not something in the abstract. The reasonableness of a decision or an action can only be judged in the totality of the facts and circumstances and having regard to the object and purpose sought to be achieved. For example, if the object is to select someone for public employment or for promotion to a higher post, the only reasonable thing to do would be to select the most suitable and meritorious among the candidates. The selection of a person of inferior merit or someone who is not even eligible would be wholly unreasonable if the object is to choose the best as it should be in case of selection for public employment or promotion to a higher post. But in case an organisation undertakes manpower planning with a view to downsize the personnel and cut down the overhead costs, very different considerations would apply and in that case the application of the yard stick for selection 15 for public employment or for promotion to a higher post would lead to results opposed to the very object of the exercise. 15. We feel that the High Court committed the fundamental mistake in completely misconstruing the object and purpose of the voluntary retirement scheme. As wrongly assumed by the High Court, the object of the scheme was not to reward the good officers or to punish the bad ones. Even though depending upon personal circumstances, voluntary retirement under the scheme might have appeared to some individual officers as personally beneficial, it was not envisaged by the bank as a means to give personal rewards or to punish individual employees by granting or refusing to grant voluntary retirement to them. The objective of the scheme as stated in the circular issued by the bank was ""to adopt measures to have optimum human resources at various levels in keeping with the business strategies, skill profile to achieve balanced age and requirement of the bank"". 16. In Bank of India and Anr. v. K. Mohandas and Ors. , (2009) 5 SCC 313, one of us (Lodha, J.) had the occasion to examine the genesis and raison d'jtre of the voluntary scheme framed by the banks; in that judgment it was observed, in paragraphs 3, 4, 5 and 36, as follows: ""3. In the month of May, 2000, Government of India, Ministry of Finance (Banking Division), advised the nationalized banks 16 to carry out detailed manpower planning as these banks were found to have 25% of their manpower as surplus. A Human Resource Management Committee was constituted to examine the said issue and to suggest suitable remedial measures. 4. The Committee so constituted observed that high establishment cost and low productivity in public sector banks affect their profitability and it was necessary for these banks to convert their human resources into assets compatible with business strategies. Inter alia, the Committee placed the draft voluntary retirement scheme with the Central Government that would assist the banks in their efforts to optimize their human resources and achieve a balanced age and skills profile in keeping with their business strategies. 5. With the approval of the Central Government, Indian Banks' Association (IBA) circulated salient features of the draft scheme to the nationalized banks for consideration and adoption by their respective boards vide its letter dated 31-8- 2000. The Board of Directors of each of the nationalized banks, keeping in view the objectives, considered the draft scheme and adopted it separately. 36. Any interpretation of the terms of VRS 2000, although contractual in nature, must meet the test of fairness. It has to be construed in a manner that avoids arbitrariness and unreasonableness on the part of the public sector banks who brought out VRS 2000 with an objective of rightsizing their manpower. The banks decided to shed surplus manpower. By formulation of the special scheme (VRS 2000), the banks intended to achieve their objective of rationalising their force as they were overstaffed. The special Scheme was, thus, oriented to lure the employees to go in for voluntary retirement. In this background, the consideration that was to pass between the parties assumes significance and a harmonious construction to the Scheme and the Pension Regulations, therefore, has to be given."" (emphasis added) 17 17. Bearing in mind the object and purpose of the scheme as explained in the decision in Bank of India it is not difficult to see how the competent authority in the bank would deal with the applications for voluntary retirement made by individual officers; other things being equal between two applicants he would like to let go the one with the inferior service record and lower potential and consequently he would accept the application of the officer with the lower merit and may not accept the request of the officer with superior merit. This is for the simple reason that in the process of shedding surplus manpower no organisation would like to lose its best people. 18. From a purely subjective point of view the decision of the competent authority may appear to be ""unfair"" or even a `punishment"" to the officer with the superior merit nevertheless it would be the proper and reasonable exercise of discretion in view of the basic objective of the scheme. We are not unconscious that the denial of request for voluntary retirement to an officer in practice may result in souring of relationship between the concerned officer and the bank (as it actually happened in this case) and as a consequence the concerned officer in future may not show the same competence and efficiency in the discharge of his duties for which he was sought to be retained in service. But that is a matter of personnel 18 management and the competent authority is expected to factor in such considerations while taking a decision on individual applications. Such considerations would certainly not be a ground for the court to interfere with the decision of the competent authority. The discretion vested in the competent authority as stipulated in paragraph 4 under the heading `General Conditions' (of the scheme) must be understood in this way and not absolute in the sense of being completely uncontrolled, whimsical or capricious. 19. Seen in this light even the grant of voluntary retirement to an employee who may not be strictly eligible under the scheme may not improve the claim of another applicant who might not only be eligible but with highly superior credentials. An employee facing a disciplinary proceeding and, therefore, ineligible under the scheme may otherwise also be completely useless. The bank may try to get rid of him by dropping the disciplinary proceeding or even by waiving the eligibility clause in his case. At worst the action of the bank may be irregular or even invalid in case of that particular employee. But unlike a selection for appointment or promotion to a superior post, this in itself would not provide a ground to another employee (legible and with superior credentials) to claim retirement as a matter of right. 19 20. In this case, however, we need not go into that aspect of the matter because it was the definite case of the bank before the High Court that no person ineligible under the scheme was granted voluntary retirement. As regards the officers/employees who were allegedly allowed voluntary retirement even though they were given charge-sheets or show cause notices in contemplation of disciplinary proceedings, the bank in its counter affidavit had explained that the decision on their application for voluntary retirement was taken by the competent authority after ""disposal"" of the charge-sheets. The High Court brushed aside the plea by observing that charge-sheets were not ""disposed of""; a charge-sheet may be recalled or a proceeding arising from the charge-sheet may lead either to exoneration or the finding of guilt of the concerned employee. It further observed that the statement was made for obfuscation of the matter in issue. 21. We are of the view that the High Court took a highly technical view of the matter. What perhaps was meant by the bank was that the decision to accept their request for voluntary retirement was taken after the proceedings against those officers/employees were closed/dropped. Here, it may be recalled that this was quite in accordance with paragraph 10 of the ""General Conditions"". 20 22. As regards the officers who were allegedly given special training and were, therefore, ineligible for voluntary retirement, only Mr. Anthony Joseph, Pondicherry Branch, was in Scale IV, i.e. in the same scale as the respondent. In regard to Anthony Joseph, the bank in its rejoinder affidavit denied that he was given training in foreign exchange. We see no reason not to accept the statement made by the bank in this regard. 23. In light of the discussion made above, we are clearly of the view, that the bank had properly appraised the respondent's claim for voluntary retirement under the scheme and its decision not to accept the request was within the legitimate exercise of discretion that did not warrant any interference by the High Court. We are, therefore, constrained to hold that the judgment of the High Court coming under appeal is quite unsustainable. 24. We, accordingly, allow the appeal, set aside the impugned judgment and order passed by the High Court and dismiss the writ petition filed by the respondent. 25. There will be no order as to costs. 26. We are told that some other case(s) between the parties are pending before the High Court on some other issues. Needless to say that that case 21 will be decided on its own merits and the decision in this appeal will not prejudice the case of the respondent. ....................................J.

Nagabhushana ...Appellant(s) - Versus - State of Karnataka & Others ...Respondent(s) J U D G M E N T GANGULY, J. 1. Leave granted. 2. This appeal is directed against the judgment and order dated 23rd July 2010 passed by Division Bench of the High Court of Karnataka whereby the learned Judges dismissed the W.A. No.1192 of 2007 which was filed impugning an acquisition proceeding to the State of Karnataka. It 1 may also be noted that while dismissing the appeal, the Division Bench affirmed the judgment of the learned Single Judge dated 28th May 2007. 3. From the perusal of the judgment of learned Single Judge it appears that the appellant claims to be the owner of the land bearing Sy. No.76/1 and Sy. No.76/2 of Thotadaguddadahalli Village, Bangalore North Taluk. The appellant alleged that these two plots of land were outside the purview of the Framework Agreement (FWA) and notification issued under Sections 28(1) and 28(4) of Karnataka Industrial Areas Development Act (KIAD Act). While dismissing the writ petition, the learned Single Judge held that the acquisition proceedings in question were challenged by the writ petitioner, the appellant herein, in a previous writ petition No.46078/03 2 which was initially accepted and the acquisition proceedings were quashed. Then on appeal, the Division Bench (in writ appeal Nos.713/04 and 2210/04) reversed the judgment of the learned Single Judge. Thereafter, the Division Bench order was upheld before this Court and this Court approved the acquisition proceedings. 4. Therefore, the writ petition, out of which this present appeal arises, purports to be an attempt to litigate once again, inter alia, on the ground that the aforesaid blocks of land were outside the purview of FWA dated 3.4.1997. The learned Judges of the Division Bench held the second round of litigation is misconceived inasmuch as the acquisition proceedings were upheld right upto this Court. The Division Bench in the impugned judgment noted the aforesaid facts which were also noted by the learned Single 3 Judge. Apart from that the Division Bench also noted that another batch of public interest litigation in W.P. No.45334/04 and connected matters were also disposed of by this Court directing the State of Karnataka and all its instrumentalities including the Housing Board to forthwith execute the project as conceived originally and upheld by this Court and it was also directed that FWA be implemented. The Division Bench, however, noted that on behalf of the appellant an additional ground has been raised that the acquisition stood vitiated since no award was passed as contemplated under Section 11A of the Land Acquisition Act (hereinafter ""the said Act""). 5. One of the contentions raised before the Division Bench on behalf of the appellant was that the question of principle of Constructive Res Judicata is not applicable 4 to a writ petition. This contention was raised in the context of alleged non- publication of award and the consequential invalidation of the acquisition proceeding. Even though that contention was raised for the first time before the Division Bench. The Division Bench, after referring to several judgments of this Court, held that the said contention is not tenable in law. The Division Bench also noted that in the earlier round of litigation the contentions relating to the land falling outside the area of FWA being acquired, were raised and were repelled. In fact the contentions, raised in the previous round of litigation, have been noted expressly in para 17 of the impugned judgment, which are as under: ""Most of the lands in question fall outside the area required for peripheral road etc. and they are fully developed. The acquisition for the benefit of private company like the NICE Ltd. could not be termed as public purpose."" ""The acquisition for peripheral road etc. would be illegal notwithstanding the 5 definition of infrastructural facilities as incorporated under Section 2 (8a) of the Act. The proposed acquisition is in respect of the alleged contract between the State and M/s. NICE Ltd. which is stated to be based on agreement dated 3.4.1997."" ""It amounts to colorable exercise of power and fraud on power and in such an event, the entire acquisition proceedings are to have been quashed by the learned Single Judge."" ""On reading of para 23(2) of the impugned order, it is clear that the proposed acquisition of land as notified under Section 28(1) of the Act is different from the alleged purpose, which are quite different and from the same, it is clear that the acquisition initiated is not bonafide, but the same is as a result of colorable exercise of power coupled with exercise of fraud on power and on this count also, the notification issued under Section 28(1) also ought to have been quashed."" ""The Government did not apply its mind to the acquisition proceedings and there is total non application of mind by the government to the relevant facts in initiating the acquisition proceedings under the KIADB Act ."" ""There was a total change in the stand of the opponents with regard to the `public purpose' which was stated in the preliminary notification vis-`-vis their statement of objection filed before the Court and moreover the conduct of M/s. NICE Company in allotting certain extent of lands to the Association of India Machine Tool Manufacturers (AIMTM) to put 6 up a big conventional centre, even before the acquisition proceedings are complete, disentitles them from supporting the acquisition of lands."" ""Since admittedly no industrial area was being framed in the lands proposed to be acquired, the KIADB could never be permitted to acquire lands for the formation of infrastructural facility without there being any industries."" 6. In the impugned judgment at para 18, the findings of the previous Division Bench, on the contentions extracted above, were also noted. Relevant parts of it are extracted: ""In so far as the appeals filed by the appellant - Indian Machine Tools Manufacturers Association in Writ Appeal Nos.3326-27/2004 are concerned, we find that there is considerable force in the submission made by the learned counsel for the appellant that the writ petition filed by the respondents 1 and 2 itself was not maintainable. In fact the learned Senior Counsel for the contesting respondent fairly conceded the same. The writ petition filed by the 2 nd respondent M. Nagabhushan in W.P. No.39559/2003 came to be dismissed by this court holding that he had purchased the land in question from its previous owner D.R. Raghavendra subsequent to final notification issued under Sec.28(4) of the Act and that further the previous owner D.R. Raghavendra had already handed over possession of the land in question to the 7 Land Acquisition Officer by accepting the award."" ""Therefore apart from the fact that there is no merit in any of the contentions urged on behalf of the land owners, we find that the appeals filed by the appellant - Indian Machine Tool Manufacturers Association has to succeed on the ground that the writ petition filed by the respondents 1 and 2 itself was not maintainable. Since the appellant - IMTMA was not a party before the learned Single Judge, the leave sought for is granted."" 7. Challenging the aforesaid judgment, the present appellant filed a special leave petition before this Court, which, on grant of leave, was numbered as Civil Appeal No.3878/2005. The grounds which were substantially raised by the present appellant in the previous appeal (No.3878/2005) have been raised again in this appeal. The alleged grounds in the present appeal about acquisition of land beyond the requirement of FWA were raised by the present appellant in the previous appeal No.3878/2005 also. 8 8. On those contentions, a three-judge Bench of this Court, while dealing with several appeals including the one filed by the present appellant, rendered a judgment in State of Karnataka and another Vs. All India Manufacturers Organisation and others - (2006) 4 SCC 683, wherein the said three- judge Bench held: ""The next contention urged on behalf of the landowners is that the lands were not being acquired for a public purpose. The counsel who have argued for the landowners have expatiated in their contention by urging that land in excess of what was required under the FWA had been acquired; land far away from the actual alignment of the road and periphery had been acquired; consequently, it is urged that even if the implementation of the highway project is assumed to be for a public purpose, acquisition of land far away therefrom would not amount to a public purpose nor would it be covered by the provisions of the KIAD Act ."" (Paragraph 76, page 711 of the report) 9. In paragraph 77 of the said report, it was further held: 9 ""In our view, this was an entirely misconceived argument. As we have pointed out in the earlier part of our judgment, the Project is an integrated infrastructure development project and not merely a highway project. The Project as it has been styled, conceived and implemented was the Bangalore-Mysore Infrastructure Corridor Project, which conceived of the development of roads between Bangalore and Mysore, for which there were several interchanges in and around the periphery of the city of Bangalore, together with numerous developmental infrastructure activities along with the highway at several points. As an integrated project, it may require the acquisition and transfer of lands even away from the main alignment of the road."" 10. In paragraph 79 at page 712 of the report, this Court affirmed the previous judgment of the Division Bench of the High Court in the following words: ""The learned Single Judge erred in assuming that the lands acquired from places away from the main alignment of the road were not a part of the Project and that is the reason he was persuaded to hold that only 60% of the land acquisition was justified because it pertained to the land acquired for the main alignment of the highway. This, in the view of the Division Bench, and in our view, was entirely erroneous. The Division Bench was right in taking the view that the Project was an integrated project intended for public purpose and, irrespective of where the land was situated, so long as it arose from the terms of the FWA, there was no 1 question of characterising it as unconnected with a public purpose. We are, therefore, in agreement with the finding of the High Court on this issue."" 11. The Division Bench judgment of the High Court was further affirmed by this Court in clear and express words in paragraph 81 of the report: ""In summary, having perused the well- considered judgment of the Division Bench which is under appeal in the light of the contentions advanced at the Bar, we are not satisfied that the acquisitions were, in any way, liable to be interfered with by the High Court, even to the extent as held by the learned Single Judge. We agree with the decision of the Division Bench that the acquisition of the entire land for the Project was carried out in consonance with the provisions of the KIAD Act for a public project of great importance for the development of the State of Karnataka. We do not think that a project of this magnitude and urgency can be held up by individuals raising frivolous and untenable objections thereto. The powers under the KIAD Act represent the powers of eminent domain vested in the State, which may need to be exercised even to the detriment of individuals' property rights so long as it achieves a larger public purpose. Looking at the case as a whole, we are satisfied that the Project is intended to represent the larger public interest of the State and that is why it was entered into and implemented all along."" 1 12. We find that disregarding the aforesaid clear finding of this Court, the appellant, on identical issues, further filed a new writ petition out of which the present appeal arises. That writ petition, as noted above, was rejected both by the learned Single Judge and by the Division Bench in clear terms. 13. It is obvious that such a litigative adventure by the present appellant is clearly against the principles of Res Judicata as well as principles of Constructive Res Judicata and principles analogous thereto. 14. The principles of Res Judicata are of universal application as it is based on two age old principles, namely, `interest reipublicae ut sit finis litium' which 1 means that it is in the interest of the State that there should be an end to litigation and the other principle is `nemo debet his ve ari, si constet curiae quod sit pro un aet eademn cause' meaning thereby that no one ought to be vexed twice in a litigation if it appears to the Court that it is for one and the same cause. This doctrine of Res Judicata is common to all civilized system of jurisprudence to the extent that a judgment after a proper trial by a Court of competent jurisdiction should be regarded as final and conclusive determination of the questions litigated and should for ever set the controversy at rest. 15. That principle of finality of litigation is based on high principle of public policy. In the absence of such a principle great oppression might result under the colour 1 and pretence of law in as much as there will be no end of litigation and a rich and malicious litigant will succeed in infinitely vexing his opponent by repetitive suits and actions. This may compel the weaker party to relinquish his right. The doctrine of Res Judicata has been evolved to prevent such an anarchy. That is why it is perceived that the plea of Res Judicata is not a technical doctrine but a fundamental principle which sustains the Rule of Law in ensuring finality in litigation. This principle seeks to promote honesty and a fair administration of justice and to prevent abuse in the matter of accessing Court for agitating on issues which have become final between the parties. 16. Justice Tek Chand delivering the unanimous Full Bench decision in the case of 1 Mussammat Lachhmi Vs. Mussammat Bhulli (ILR Lahore Vol.VIII 384) traced the history of this doctrine both in Hindu and Mohammedan jurisprudence as follows:- ""In the Mitakshra (Book II, Chap. I, Section V, verse 5) one of the four kinds of effective answers to a suit is ""a plea by former judgment"" and in verse 10, Katyayana is quoted as laying down that ""one against whom a judgment had formerly been given, if he bring forward the matter again, must be answered by a plea of Purva Nyaya or former judgment"" (Macnaughten and Colebrooke's translation, page 22). The doctrine, however, seems to have been recognized much earlier in Hindu Jurisprudence, judging from the fact that both the Smriti Chandrika (Mysore Edition, pages 97-98) and the Virmitrodaya (Vidya-Sagar Edition, page 77) base the defence of Prang Nyaya (=former decision) on the following text of the ancient law- giver Harita, who is believed by some Orientalists to have flourished in the 9th Century B.C. and whose Smriti is now extant only in fragments:- ""The plaintiff should be non- suited if the defendant avers: `in this very affair, there was litigation between him and myself previously,' and it is found that the plaintiff had lost his case"". There are texts of Prasara (Bengal Asiatic Society Edition, page 56) and of the Mayukha (Kane's Edition, page 15) to the same effect. 1 Among Muhammadan law-givers similar effect was given to the plea of ""Niza-i-munfasla"" or ""Amar Mania taqrir mukhalif."" Under Roman Law, as administered by the Proetors' Courts, a defendant could repel the plaintiff's claim by means of `exceptio rei judicatoe"" or plea of former judgment. The subject received considerable attention at the hands of Ruman jurists and as stated in Roby's Roman Private Law (Vol.II, page 338) the general principle recognised was that ""one suit and one decision was enough for any single dispute"" and that ""a matter once brought to trial should not be tried except, of course, by way of appeal"". (Page 391-392 of the report) 17. The learned Judge also noted that in British India the rule of Res Judicata was first introduced by Section 16 of the Bengal Regulation, III of 1973 which prohibited the Zilla and City Courts from entertaining any cause which, from the production of a former decree or the record of the Court, appears to have been heard and determined by any Judge or any Superintendent of a Court having competent 1 jurisdiction. The learned Judge found that the earliest legislative attempt at codification of the law on the subject was made in 1859, when the first Civil Procedure Code was enacted, whereunder Section 2 of the Code barred every Court from taking cognizance of suits which, on the same cause of action, have been heard and determined by a Court of competent jurisdiction. The learned Judge opined, and in our view rightly, that this was partial recognition of the English rule in so far as it embodied the principles relating to Estoppel by judgment or Estopel by record. 18. Thereafter, when the Code was again revised in 1877, the operation of the rule was extended in Section 13 and the bar was no longer confined to the retrial of a dispute relating to the same cause of action but the prohibition was extended against 1 reagitating an issue, which had been heard and finally decided between the same parties in a former suit by a competent court. The learned Judge also noted that before the principle assumed its present form in Section 11 of the Code of 1908, the Section was expanded twice. However, the learned Judge noted that Section 11 is not exhaustive of the law on the subject. 19. It is nobody's case that the appellant did not know the contents of FWA. From this it follows that it was open to the appellant to question, in the previous proceeding filed by it, that his land which was acquired was not included in the FWA. No reasonable explanation was offered by the appellant to indicate why he had not raised this issue. Therefore, in our judgment, such an issue cannot be raised in this 1 proceeding in view of the doctrine of Constructive Res Judicata. 20. It may be noted in this context that while applying the principles of Res Judicata the Court should not be hampered by any technical rules of interpretation. It has been very categorically opined by Sir Lawrence Jenkins that ""the application of the rule by Courts in India should be influenced by no technical considerations of form but by matter of substance within the limits allowed by law"". [See Sheoparsan Singh Vs. Rammanandan Prasad Singh, (1916) 1 I.L.R. 43 Cal. 694 at page 706 (P.C.)]. 21. Therefore, any proceeding which has been initiated in breach of the principle of Res Judicata is prima-facie a proceeding which has been initiated in abuse of the process of Court. 1 22. A Constitution Bench of this Court in Devilal Modi Vs. Sales Tax Officer, Ratlam & Ors. - AIR 1965 SC 1150, has explained this principle in very clear terms: ""But the question as to whether a citizen should be allowed to challenge the validity of the same order by successive petitions under Art. 226 , cannot be answered merely in the light of the significance and importance of the citizens' fundamental rights. The general principle underlying the doctrine of res judicata is ultimately based on considerations of public policy. One important consideration of public policy is that the decisions pronounced by courts of competent jurisdiction should be final, unless they are modified or reversed by appellate authorities; and the other principle is that no one should be made to face the same kind of litigation twice over, because such a process would be contrary to considerations of fair play and justice, vide : Daryao Vs. State of U.P. , 1962-1 SCR 575; (AIR 1961 SC 1457)."" 23. This Court in All India Manufacturers Organisation (supra) explained in clear terms that principle behind the doctrine of 2 Res Judicata is to prevent an abuse of the process of Court. 24. In explaining the said principle the Bench in All India Manufacturers Organisation (supra) relied on the following formulation of Lord Justice Somervell in Greenhalgh Vs. Mallard - (1947) 2 All ER 255 (CA): ""I think that on the authorities to which I will refer it would be accurate to say that res judicata for this purpose is not confined to the issues which the court is actually asked to decide, but that it covers issues or facts which are so clearly part of the subject-matter of the litigation and so clearly could have been raised that it would be an abuse of the process of the court to allow a new proceeding to be started in respect of them."" 25. The Bench also noted that the judgment of the Court of Appeal in ""Greenhalgh"" was approved by this Court in State of U.P. Vs. Nawab Hussain - (1977) 2 SCC 806 at page 809, para 4. 2 26. Following all these principles a Constitution Bench of this Court in Direct Recruit Class II Engg. Officers' Assn. Vs. State of Maharashtra - (1990) 2 SCC 715 laid down the following principle: ""......an adjudication is conclusive and final not only as to the actual matter determined but as to every other matter which the parties might and ought to have litigated and have had decided as incidental to or essentially connected with subject matter of the litigation and every matter coming into the legitimate purview of the original action both in respect of the matters of claim and defence. Thus, the principle of constructive res judicata underlying Explanation IV of Section 11 of the Code of Civil Procedure was applied to writ case. We, accordingly hold that the writ case is fit to be dismissed on the ground of res judicata"" 27. In view of such authoritative pronouncement of the Constitution Bench of this Court, there can be no doubt that the principles of Constructive Res Judicata, as explained in explanation IV to Section 11 of the CPC, are also applicable to writ petitions. 2 28. Thus, the attempt to re-argue the case which has been finally decided by the Court of last resort is a clear abuse of process of the Court, regardless of the principles of Res Judicata, as has been held by this Court in K.K. Modi Vs. K.N. Modi and Ors. - (1998) 3 SCC 573. In paragraph 44 of the report, this principle has been very lucidly discussed by this Court and the relevant portions whereof are extracted below: ""One of the examples cited as an abuse of the process of the court is relitigation. It is an abuse of the process of the court and contrary to justice and public policy for a party to relitigate the same issue which has already been tried and decided earlier against him. The reagitation may or may not be barred as res judicata..."" 29. In coming to the aforementioned finding, this Court relied on the Supreme Court Practice 1995 published by Sweet & Maxwell. The relevant principles laid down in the 2 aforesaid practice and which have been accepted by this Court are as follows: ""This term connotes that the process of the court must be used bona fide and properly and must not be abused. The court will prevent improper use of its machinery and will in a proper case, summarily prevent its machinery from being used as a means of vexation and oppression in the process of litigation. ... The categories of conduct rendering a claim frivolous, vexatious or an abuse of process are not closed but depend on all the relevant circumstances. And for this purpose considerations of public policy and the interests of justice may be very material."" 30. In the premises aforesaid, it is clear that the attempt by the appellant to re-agitate the same issues which were considered by this Court and were rejected expressly in the previous judgment in All India Manufacturers Organisation (supra), is a clear instance of an abuse of process of this Court apart from the fact that such issues are barred by principles of Res 2 Judicata or Constructive Res Judicata and principles analogous thereto. 31. The other point which has been argued by the appellant is that notification dated 30.3.2004 issued under Section 28(4) of KIAD Act stands vitiated in view of the provisions of Section 11A of the said Act inasmuch as no award was passed within two years from the date of the notification. 32. This Court is unable to accept the aforesaid contention for the following reasons. 33. It may be noted that the said question was not urged by the appellant in its writ petition before the learned Single Judge. Of course, this was urged before the Division Bench of the High Court unsuccessfully. Apart from that we also 2 find no substance in the aforesaid contentions. 34. If we compare the provisions of Sections 28(4) and 28(5) of KIAD Act with the provisions of Sections 4 and 6 of the said Act, we discern a substantial difference between the two. 35. In order to appreciate the purport of both Sections 28(4) and 28(5) of the KIAD Act, they are to be read together and are set out below: ""28. Acquisition of land- xxx xxx (4) After orders are passed under sub-Section (3), where the State Government is satisfied that any land should be acquired for the purpose specified in the notification issued under sub- section(1), a declaration shall, by notification in the official Gazette, be made to that effect. (5) On the publication in the official Gazette of the 2 declaration under sub-section (4), the land shall vest absolutely in the State Government free from all encumbrances."" 36. The appellant has not challenged the validity of the aforesaid provisions. Therefore, on a combined reading of the provisions of Sections 28(4) and 28(5) of the KIAD Act, it is clear that on the publication of the notification under Section 28(4) of the KIAD Act i.e. from 30.3.2004, the land in question vested in the State free from all encumbrances by operation of Section 28(5) of the KIAD Act, whereas the land acquired under the said Act vests only under Section 16 thereof, which runs as under: ""16. Power to take possession:- When the Collector has made an award under section 11 , he may take possession of the land, which shall thereupon vest absolutely in the Government free from all encumbrances"" 2 37. On a comparison of the aforesaid provisions, namely, Sections 28(4) and 28(5) of the KIAD Act with Section 16 of the said Act, it is clear that the land which is subject to acquisition proceeding under the said Act gets vested with the Government only when the Collector makes an award under Section 11 , and the Government takes possession. Under Sections 28(4) and 28(5) of the KIAD Act, such vesting takes place by operation of law and it has nothing to do with the making of any award. This is where Sections 28(4) and 28(5) of the KIAD Act are vitally different from Sections 4 and 6 of the said Act. 38. A somewhat similar question came up for consideration before a three-judge Bench of this Court in Pratap and Another Vs. State of Rajasthan and Ors. - (1996) 3 SCC 1. In that case the acquisition proceedings 2 commenced under Section 52(2) of Rajasthan Urban Improvement Act, 1959 and the same contentions were raised, namely, that the acquisition notification gets invalidated for not making an award within a period of two years from the date of notification. 39. Repelling the said contention, the learned Judges held that once the land is vested in the Government, the provisions of Section 11A are not attracted and the acquisition proceedings will not lapse. (para 12 at page 8 of the report) 40. In Munithimmaiah Vs. State of Karnataka and others reported in (2002) 4 SCC 326 this Court held that the provisions of Sections 6 and 11A of the said Act do not apply to the provisions of Bangalore Development Authority Act, 1976 (BDA Act ). In paragraph 15 at page 335 of the report this Court made a distinction between the purposes of 2 the two enactments and held that all the provisions of said Act do not apply to BDA Act . 41. Subsequently, the Constitution Bench of this Court in Offshore Holdings Pvt. Ltd. Vs. Bangalore Development Authority and Ors. , reported in 2011 (1) SCALE 533 - 574, held that Section 11A of the said Act does not apply to acquisition under BDA Act . 42. The same principle is attracted to the present case also. Here also on a comparison between the provisions of said Act and KIAD Act , we find that those two Acts were enacted to achieve substantially different purposes. In so far as KIAD Act is concerned, from its Statement of Objects and Reasons, it is clear that the same was enacted to achieve the following purposes: 3 ""It is considered necessary to make provision for the orderly establishment and development of Industries in suitable areas in the State. To achieve this object, it is proposed to specify suitable areas for Industrial Development and establish a Board to develop such areas and make available lands therein for establishment of Industries."" 43. KIAD Act is of course a self contained code. The said Act is primarily a law regulating acquisition of land for public purpose and for payment of compensation. Acquisition of land under the said Act is not concerned solely with the purpose of planned development of any city. It has to cater to different situations which come within the expanded horizon of public purpose. Recently the Constitution Bench of this Court in Girnar Traders Vs. State of Maharashtra & Others , reported in 2011 (1) SCALE 223 held that Section 11A of the said Act does not apply to acquisition under the 3 provisions of Maharashtra Regional and Town Planning Act, 1966 . 44. The learned counsel for the appellant has relied on the judgment of this Court in the case of Mariyappa and others Vs. State of Karnataka and others reported in (1998) 3 SCC 276. The said decision was cited for the purpose of contending that Section 11A is applicable to an acquisition under KIAD Act . In Mariyappa (supra) before coming to hold that provision of Section 11A of the Central Act applies to Karnataka Acquisition of Land for Grant of House Sites Act, 1972 (hereinafter ""1972 Act""), this Court held that the 1972 Act is not a self-contained code. The Court also held that the 1972 Act and the Central Acts are supplemental to each other to the extent that unless the Central Act supplements the Karnataka Act , the latter cannot function. 3 The Court further held that both the Acts, namely, 1972 Act and the Central Act deals with the same subject. But in the instant case the KIAD Act is a self-contained code and the Central Act is not supplemental to it. Therefore, the ratio in Mariyappa (supra) is not attracted to the facts of the present case. 45. Following the aforesaid well settled principles, this Court is of the opinion that there is no substance in the contention of appellant that acquisition under KIAD Act lapsed for alleged non- compliance with the provisions of Section 11A of the said Act. 46. For the reasons aforesaid all the contentions of the appellant, being without any substance, fail and the appeal is dismissed. 3 47. For the reasons indicated hereinabove, this Court holds that the filing of this appeal before this Court is an instance of an abuse of the process of Court. The main purpose was to hold up, on one or other pretext, the land acquisition proceeding which, as held by this Court in All India Manufacturers Organisation (supra), was initiated to `achieve a larger public purpose'. 48. In that view of the matter, this court makes it clear that the State Government should complete the project as early as possible and should not do anything, including releasing any land acquired under this project, as that may impede the completion of the project and would not be compatible with the larger public interest which the project is intended to serve. 3 49. This Court, therefore, dismisses this appeal with costs assessed at Rs.10 Lacs, to be paid by the appellant in favour of Karnataka High Court Legal Services Authority within a period of six weeks from date. In default, a proceeding will be initiated against the appellant on a complaint by the Karnataka High Court Legal Services Authority by the appropriate authority under the relevant Public Demand Recovery Act for recovery of this cost amount as arrears of land revenue. 50. The appeal is, thus, dismissed with costs as aforesaid. Interim orders, if any, are vacated. .......................J. (G.S. SINGHVI) 3 .......................J.

"Md.Sukur Ali vs State Of Assam on 24 February, 2011","546","(arising out of S.L.P. (CRL.) No(s).679 of 2011) MD.SUKUR ALI Appellant(s) VERSUS STATE OF ASSAM Respondent(s) O R D E R Leave granted. Heard learned counsel for the parties. We have also heard Mr. Fali S. Nariman, learned senior counsel, who very kindly consented to assist us as Amicus Curiae in this case in which an important constitutional and legal question is involved. That question is whether in a criminal case if the counsel for the accused does not appear, for whatever reasons, should the case be decided in the absence of the counsel against the accused, or the Court should appoint an amicus curiae to defend the accused ? In the present case, it appears that Criminal Appeal 137 of 2003 was decided by the Gauhati High Court on :1: 01.06.2010 in the absence of the counsel for the appellant- accused and the conviction was upheld. Mr. Nariman, learned senior counsel, pointed out that earlier the counsel for the appellant-accused was Mr. A.S. Choudhury but the appellant changed his counsel and appointed Mr. B. Sinha in the year 2007 as his new counsel, and this fact is corroborated by affidavit. Unfortunately, the name of Mr. Sinha as counsel for the appellant was not shown in the cause list when the case was listed and the name of the former counsel Mr. Choudhury was shown. In these circumstances, Mr. Sinha who was engaged by the appellant as his new counsel did not appear. We are of the opinion that even assuming that the counsel for the accused does not appear because of the counsel's negligence or deliberately, even then the Court should not decide a criminal case against the accused in the absence of his counsel since an accused in a criminal case should not suffer for the fault of his counsel and in such a situation the Court should appoint another counsel as amicus curiae to defend the accused. This is because liberty of a person is the most important feature of our Constitution. Article 21 which guarantees protection of life and personal liberty is the most important fundamental right of the fundamental rights guaranteed by the :2: Constitution. Article 21 can be said to be the 'heart and soul' of the fundamental rights. In our opinion, a criminal case should not be decided against the accused in the absence of a counsel. We are fortified in the view we are taking by a decision of the US Supreme Court in Powell Vs. Alabama, 287 US 45 (1932), in which it was observed :- ""What, then, does a hearing include? Historically and in practice, in our own country at least, it has always included the right to the aid of counsel when desired and provided by the party asserting the right. The right to be heard would be, in many cases, of little avail if it did not comprehend the right to be heard by counsel. Even the intelligent and educated layman has small and sometimes no skill in the science of law. If charged with crime, he is incapable, generally, of determining for himself whether the indictment is good or bad. He is unfamiliar with the rules of evidence. Left without the aid of counsel he may be put on trial without a proper charge, and convicted upon incompetent evidence, or evidence irrelevant to the issue or otherwise inadmissible. He lacks both the skill and knowledge adequately to prepare his defense, even though he have a perfect one. He requires the guiding hand of counsel at every step in the proceedings against him. Without it, though he be not guilty, he faces the danger of conviction because he does not know how to establish his innocence. If that be true of men of intelligence, how much more true is it of the ignorant and illiterate, or those of feeble intellect. If in any case, civil or criminal, a State or federal court were arbitrarily to refuse to hear a party by counsel, employed by and appearing for him, it reasonably may not be doubted that such a refusal would be a denial of a hearing, and, therefore, of due process in the constitutional sense"". :3: The above decision of the US Supreme Court was cited with approval by this Court in A.S. Mohammed Rafi Vs. State of Tamil Nadu & Ors. , AIR 2011 Supreme Court 308, vide para 24. A similar view which we are taking here was also taken by this Court in Man Singh & Anr. Vs. State of Madhya Pradesh (2008) 9 SCC 542, and in Bapu Limbaji Kamble Vs. State of Maharashtra, (2005) 11 SC 412. In this connection we may also refer to Articles 21 and 22(1) of the Constitution. Articles 21 and Articles 22(1) are as under : "" Article 21. Protection of life and personal liberty. - No person shall be deprived of his life or personal liberty except according to procedure established by law"". Article 22(1). Protection against arrest and detention in certain cases. - (1) No person who is arrested shall be detained in custody without being informed, as soon as may be, of the grounds for such arrest nor shall he be denied the right to consult, and to be defended by, a legal practitioner of his choice."" In Maneka Gandhi vs. Union of India AIR 1978 SC 597, it has been held by a Constitution Bench of this Court that the procedure for depriving a person of his life or liberty should be fair, reasonable and just. We are of the opinion :4: that it is not fair or just that a criminal case should be decided against an accused in the absence of a counsel. It is only a lawyer who is conversant with law who can properly defend an accused in a criminal case. Hence, in our opinion, if a criminal case (whether a trial or appeal/revision) is decided against an accused in the absence of a counsel, there will be violation of Article 21 of the Constitution. The right to appear through counsel has existed in England for over three centuries. In ancient Rome there were great lawyers e,g, Cicero, Scaevola, Crassus, etc. who defended the accused. In fact the higher the human race has progressed in civilization, the clearer and stronger has that right appeared, and the more firmly has it been held and asserted. Even in the Nuremberg trials the Nazi war criminals, responsible for killing millions of persons, were yet provided counsel. Therefore when we say that the accused should be provided counsel we are not bringing into existence a new principle but simply recognizing what already existed and which civilized people have long enjoyed. :5: Apart from the above, we agree with the eminent jurist Seervai who has said in his ""Constitutional Law of India', Third Edition, Vol. I, Pg. 857:- ""The right to be defended by counsel does not appear to have been stressed, and was clearly not considered in any detail in Ajaib Singh 's case (1953) SCR 254. But the right of a person accused of an offence, or against whom any proceedings were taken under the Cr.P.C . is a valuable right which was recognized by Section 340 Cr.P.C. Article 22 (1) on its language makes that right a constitutional right, and unless there are compelling reasons, Article 22 (1) ought not to be cut down by judicial construction........ It is submitted that Article 22 (1) makes the statutory right under Section 340 Cr.P.C. a Constitutional right in respect of criminal or quasi-criminal proceedings."" We are fully in agreement with Mr. Seervai regarding his above observations. The Founding Fathers of our Constitution were themselves freedom fighters who had seen :6: civil liberties of our people trampled under foreign rule, and who had themselves been incarcerated for long period under the formula `Na vakeel, na daleel, na appeal' (No lawyer, no hearing, no appeal). Many of them were lawyers by profession, and knew the importance of counsel, particularly in criminal cases. It was for this reason that they provided for assistance by counsel under Article 22 (1) , and that provision must be given the widest construction to effectuate the intention of the Founding Fathers. In this connection, we may also refer to the ringing speech of Rt. Hon. Srinivasa Sastri, speaking in the Imperial Legislative Council, at the introduction of the Rowlatt Bill, Feb 7, 1919 (the Rowlatt Act prohibited counsels to appear for the accused in cases under the Act):- ""When Government undertakes a repressive policy, the innocent are not safe. Men like me would not be considered innocent. The innocent then is he who forswears politics, who takes no part in the public movements of the times, who retires into his house, mumbles his prayers, pays his taxes, and salaams all the government officials all round. The man who interferes in politics, the man who goes about collecting money for any public purpose, the man who addresses a public :7: meeting, then becomes a suspect. I am always on the borderland and I, therefore, for personal reasons, if for nothing else, undertake to say that the possession, in the hands of the Executive, of powers of this drastic nature will not hurt only the wicked. It will hurt the good as well as the bad, and there will be such a lowering of public spirit, there will be such a lowering of the political tone in the country, that all your talk of responsible government will be mere mockery... ""Much better that a few rascals should walk abroad than that the honest man should be obliged for fear of the law of the land to remain shut up in his house, to refrain from the activities which it is in his nature to indulge in, to abstain from all political and public work merely because there is a dreadful law in the land."" In Gideon vs Wainwright, 372 US 335 (1963) Mr. Justice Hugo Black of the US Supreme Court delivering the unanimous judgment of the Court observed:- ""Lawyers in criminal courts are necessities, not luxuries"" In Brewer vs William, 430 US 387 (1977) Mr Justice Stewart delivering the opinion of the US Supreme Court observed;- ""The pressures on state executive and judicial officers charged with the administration of the criminal law are great. But it is precisely the predictability of those pressures that makes imperative a resolute loyalty to the guarantees that the Constitution extends to us all. "" :8: For the reasons stated above, we allow this Appeal, set aside the impugned judgment of the High Court and remand the matter to the High Court for a fresh decision after hearing Mr. Sinha, the new learned counsel for the appellant in the High Court, or any other counsel which has been engaged by the appellant, or in the absence of these, an amicus curiae being a lawyer practising on the criminal side. The case shall be heard by a Bench of Judges other than those who passed the impugned judgment. The Order dated 24.01.2011 passed by this Court granting bail to the appellant shall continue till the appeal is decided by the High Court. We reiterate that in the absence of a counsel, for whatever reasons, the case should not be decided forthwith against the accused but in such a situation the Court should appoint a counsel who is practising on the criminal side as amicus curiae and decide the case after fixing another date and hearing him. If on the next date of hearing the counsel, who ought to have appeared on the previous date but did not appear, now appears, but cannot show sufficient cause for his non-appearance on the earlier date, then he will be :9: precluded from appearing and arguing the case on behalf of the accused. But, in such a situation, it is open to the accused to either engage another counsel or the Court may proceed with the hearing of the case by the counsel appointed as amicus curiae. ......................J.

"Vishnu Agarwal vs State Of U.P. & Anr on 22 February, 2011","1323","VISHNU AGARWAL Appellant (s) VERSUS STATE OF U.P. & ANR. Respondent(s) WITH CRIMINAL APPEAL NO. 875 OF 2006 O R D E R Criminal Appeal No. 1323/2004 Heard learned Counsel for the parties. This appeal has been filed against the impugned Judgment of the Allahabad High Court dated 29.1.2004 in Criminal Revision No. 136/1998. It appears that the aforesaid Criminal Revision was listed in the High Court on 2.9.2003. No one appeared on behalf of the Revisionist, though the Counsels for respondents appeared. In these circumstances, the judgment was passed. Subsequently, an application was moved for recall of the Order dated 2.9.2003 alleging that the case was shown in the computer list and not in the main list of the High Court, and hence, the learned Counsel for the Revisionist had not noted the case and hence he did not appear. -2- It often happens that sometimes a case is not noted by the Counsel or his clerk in the cause list, and hence, the Counsel does not appear. This is a human mistake and can happen to anyone. Hence, the High Court recalled the order dated 2.9.2003 and directed the case to be listed for fresh hearing. The aforesaid order recalling the order dated 2.9.2003 has been challenged before us in this appeal. Learned Counsel for the appellant has relied on the decision of this Court in Hari Singh Mann Vs. Harbhajan Singh Bajwa AIR 2001 SC 43. Para 10 of the said judgment states: "" Section 362 of the Code mandates that no Court, when it has signed its judgment or final order disposing of a case shall alter or review the same except to correct a clerical or arithmetical error. The Section is based on an acknowledged principle of law that once a matter is finally disposed of by a Court, the said Court in the absence of a specific statutory provision becomes functus officio and disentitled to entertain a fresh prayer for the same relief unless the former order of final disposal is set aside by a Court of competent jurisdiction in a manner prescribed by law. The Court becomes functus officio the moment the official order disposing of a case is signed. Such an order cannot be altered except to the extent of correcting a clerical or arithmetical error. The reliance of the respondent on Talab Haji Hussain's case (AIR 1958 SC 376)(supra) is misconceived. Even in that case it was pointed that inherent powers conferred on High Courts under Section 561A(Section 482 of the new Code) has to be exercised sparingly, carefully and with caution and only where such exercise is justified by the tests specifically laid down in the section itself. It is not disputed that the petition filed under Section 482 of the Code had been finally disposed of by the High Court on 7.1.1999. The new Section 362 of the Code which was drafted keeping in view the recommendations of the 41st Report of the Law Commission and the Joint Select Committees appointed for the purpose, has extended the bar of review not only to the judgment but also to the final orders other than the judgment."" -3- Learned Counsel for the appellant Mr. Manoj Swarup submitted that in view of the aforesaid decision, the High Court erred in law in recalling the Order dated 2.9.2003. We regret we cannot agree. In our opinion, Section 362 cannot be considered in a rigid and over technical manner to defeat the ends of justice. As Brahaspati has observed : ""Kevalam Shastram Ashritya Na Kartavyo Vinirnayah Yuktiheeney Vichare tu Dharmahaani Prajayate"" which means: ""The Court should not give its decision based only on the letter of the law. For if the decision is wholly unreasonable, injustice will follow."" Apart from the above, we are of the opinion that the application filed by the respondent was an application for recall of the Order dated 2.9.2003 and not for review. In Asit Kumar Vs. State of West Bengal and Ors. 2009(1) SCR 469, this Court made a distinction between recall and review which is as under:- -4- ""There is a distinction between ...... a review petition and a recall petition. While in a review petition, the Court considers on merits whether there is an error apparent on the face of the record, in a recall petition the Court does not go into the merits but simply recalls an order which was passed without giving an opportunity of hearing to an affected party. We are treating this petition under Article 32 as a recall petition because the order passed in the decision in All Bengal Licensees Association Vs. Raghabendra Singth & Ors. [2007(11) SCC 374] cancelling certain licences was passed without giving opportunity of hearing to the persons who had been granted licences."" Hence, we see no error in the impugned order passed by the High Court. The appeal fails and is accordingly dismissed. Crl. Appeal No. 875 of 2006 The Appeal is dismissed as having become infructuous. .......................J. (MARKANDEY KATJU) .......................J. (GYAN SUDHA MISRA) NEW DELHI FEBRUARY 23, 2011"

APPELLANT VERSUS RAJASEKARAN & ORS. ...... RESPONDENTS O R D E R 1. This is rather an unfortunate case. There were five accused in all who were sentenced by the trial court for offences punishable under Section 376(2)(g) , 201 of the Indian Penal Code as well as Section 3(2) (v) of the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act, 1989 . The allegation was that the five accused, and A1 in particular, who was the main accused and involved with the deceased in a clandestine relationship, had raped her on the night intervening the 28 and 29th of January, 1999. The trial court in its judgment dated 31st August, 2000 held the case against the accused to be proved and they were, accordingly, sentenced to death under section 302 or Section 302 / 34 of the IPC and to various terms of imprisonment under the various other sections under Crl.A. 6-8 of 2004 2 which they had been charged. 2. An appeal was thereafter taken by the accused to the High Court and a reference was also made for the confirmation of the death sentence. The High Court has by its impugned judgment declined the reference and at the same time allowed the appeal of the accused acquitting them in toto. 3. The present appeals have been filed at the instance of the complainant who is the father of the deceased. We see from the record that A1 was the main accused. As per the death certificate which has been put on record, he has passed away on the 30th June, 2009. The appeal qua him is, accordingly, abated. We have, accordingly, examined the evidence with respect to A2 to A5. 4. We have gone through the evidence very carefully keeping in view the gravity of the offence. We, however, find that there is no evidence with respect to the involvement of A2 to A5. The High Court has taken cognizance of the fact and observed that certain items had been recovered at the instance of A2 and A4 and they were a haystack, a nylon wire and a plastic wire which were not required to commit the murder. We see that all these items are of common use and have not been connected with the incident. The learned counsel Crl.A. 6-8 of 2004 3 for the appellant has, however, argued that the evidence of P.W. 3 would show that accused A2 to A5 had also been seen with the deceased and A1 moving around together. We have carefully perused the statement of this witness and find a serious flaw therein inasmuch that in his statement recorded under Section 161 Cr.P.C. this fact had not been mentioned by him and on the contrary the evidence suggests that all the five accused and the deceased had been seen together two days earlier to the incident. The High Court was, therefore, to our mind, justified in holding that the time lag made it difficult to connect A2 to A5 with the incident. We also put to the learned counsel for the appellant if there was any other evidence with respect to the involvement of the accused. She candidly admitted that there was none. 5. We thus find no merit in these appeals which are, accordingly, dismissed. ...... ..................J [HARJIT SINGH BEDI] ........................J [CHANDRAMAULI KR.

"Rajalingam vs State Rep.By Inspector Of Police on 23 February, 2011","11","RAJALINGAM .... APPELLANT Versus STATE REP. BY INSPECTOR OF POLICE .... RESPONDENTS O R D E R 1. Three accused, including the sole appellant herein, were put on trial for offence under Section 302 / 34 of the Indian Penal Code, alternatively under Section 304-A of the Indian Penal Code. The Trial Court convicted the appellant under Section 302 and other two accused under Section 302 / 34 of the Indian Penal Code and sentenced them to undergo life imprisonment. 2. Aggrieved by the conviction, they preferred C.A. No. 287 of 1998 and the Madras High Court by the impugned judgment maintained the conviction of the sole appellant but set aside the conviction and sentence of the other two accused persons and that is how the appellant is before us with the leave of the Court. 3. According to the prosecution, the appellant was employed as wireman while the other accused persons were employed as lineman at the Divisional Office of the State Electricity Board, Pallapatty. The 2 deceased Anandhan, the son of P.W.-1 Ponnambalam and P.W.-17 Shanmigathai were employed as contract labourers in the Board. According to the prosecution, prior to the date of incident, the staff of the Electricity Board collected donation during the Ramzan festival but the deceased refused to be associated with the collection of donation. It is alleged that during that period, appellant told him that he would be killed by electrocution. The prosecution has further alleged that on 6th of August,1991 at about 5.30 p.m., the appellant alongwith other accused came to the residence of the deceased and told him that an electric fault is to be rectified at Chinna Odai Street, Pallapatti. The deceased Anandhan was taken to the said place for rectification of the fault and was asked to climb on the electric post. According to the prosecution, appellant was standing down the electric post while the other accused were near the transformer and had switched off the electric line. It has further been alleged that while the work was going on, the appellant informed the other accused that work is over and they can switch on the line and as directed, the line was switched on and the deceased who was at work was electrocuted. In relation to the incident, a report was submitted by Kannan (P.W.-15), Junior Engineer of the Electricity Board to the Police Station and after investigation, charge sheet under Section 304-A of the Indian Penal Code was filed. It is relevant here to state that P.W.-1 Ponnambalam, the father of the deceased filed complaint inter alia alleging that the appellant alongwith other accused committed the murder of his 3 son in furtherance of their common intention. 4. The trial of the accused persons, for offence under Section 304-A of the Indian Penal Code was pending before the Magistrate whereas the prosecution under Section 302 / 34 of the Indian Penal Code was before the Sessions Judge. As both the prosecutions related to the same offence, the matter pending before the Magistrate for trial was sent to the Sessions Judge and both the cases were tried together in which common evidence was led. 5. The Trial Court, on appreciation of the evidence, came to the conclusion that all the accused in furtherance of their common object caused the death of the deceased Anandhan and accordingly convicted and sentenced all of them as above. 6. On appeal, the High Court acquitted the other accused persons but convicted the appellant under Section 302 of the Indian Penal Code and while doing so, observed as follows: ""18. Therefore, from the circumstances available, it would be abundantly clear that it was A-1 who with his previous motive aggrieved over the non-cooperation of the deceased in respect of collection of amounts during Ramzan festival has taken him to the electric post No. 235 and asked him to do the work. When the deceased was carrying on the work, A-1 gave instruction to A-2 and A-3 to switch on the transformer and caused his death."" 7. Mr. S. GuruKrishna Kumar, learned counsel appearing on behalf of the appellant submits that in the police case and in the complaint case, different allegations have been levelled, which renders the prosecution story unreliable. He points out that the evidence of P.W.-2 Rengan, P.W.-3 4 Azhagan and P.W.4 Sampath were recorded for the first time in Court and they have admitted this fact in their cross-examination. He has referred to the topography of the place of occurrence as had surfaced in the evidence of prosecution witnesses and submits that from their evidence, it is clear that distance between transformer and the electric post was not only large but intervened by several buildings and therefore it was not possible for the appellant to give signal for switching on the line to the other accused. He has also referred to the evidence of P.W.-5 and submits that from his evidence, it would be evident that the prosecution has not come up with the true story. On all these grounds, the appellant deserves to be granted the benefit of doubt, submits Mr. Kumar. 8. Ms. Promila, learned counsel, however, representing the respondents submits that both the Courts have concurrently found the appellant guilty, his conviction does not deserve any interference by this Court. 9. We have appreciated the rival submissions and find substance in the submission of Mr. S. GuruKrishna Kumar. P.W.-2 Rengan is a road side astrologer and claimed to be a witness to the occurrence but has admitted that his statement was never recorded by the police during the course of investigation and for the first time he is deposing during the trial. Similar is the admission of P.W.-3 Azhagan, a rickshaw puller and P.W.-4 Sampath, a Tailor. P.W.-5 Gopal has stated in his evidence that the accused Sundararaj (since acquitted) had gone to the work at Chinna 5 Odai Street after switching off the line from the transformer and after completing the work, he returned and switched on the electricity line. According to his evidence, while the acquitted accused was near the transformer, the appellant herein, came and asked to switch off the line as the deceased had got shock on the pole. He has not been declared hostile by the prosecution. From his evidence, it seems that the transformer was at a distance from the electric pole where the deceased got electrocuted and the appellant rushed there to ensure that the line is switched off. Thus, this witness has come out with an entirely different story. Further from the topography of the place of occurrence, it was not feasible for the appellant to instruct other accused standing near the transformer to switch on the line. In the face of the aforesaid, we are of the opinion that it would be unsafe to sustain the conviction of the appellant on the basis of the evidence on record. Accordingly, he is entitled to be given the benefit of doubt and we grant him that. 10. The appellant is on bail. He shall be discharged of his bail bonds. 11. In the result, the appeal is allowed, impugned judgment of conviction and sentence is set aside with the direction aforesaid. ................................................J.

"Bachni Devi & Anr vs State Of Haryana Th. Secy. Home Dep on 8 February, 2011","831","Bachni Devi & Anr. ...Appellants Versus State of Haryana Through Secretary, Home Department ...Respondent JUDGEMENT R.M. LODHA, J. The mother (A-1) and son (A-2) are in appeal as both of them have been convicted by the Additional Sessions Judge (I), Kurukshetra for the offence punishable under Section 304B of the Indian Penal Code ( IPC ) and sentenced to suffer rigorous imprisonment of seven years. The High Court of Punjab and Haryana affirmed their conviction and sentence and did not interfere with the judgment of the trial court. 2. Kanta died within 3 months of her marriage. On August 11, 1990, she was found dead by hanging from a ceiling fan in the appellants' house. Kanta hailed from a poor family. Her father, Pale Ram (PW-8) is a Rikshawpuller. A-2 and Kanta got married on May 12, 1990. About 20 days prior to Kanta's death, A-1 had gone to the house of PW-8 and told him that her son A-2 wanted to start milk vending business and for that a motorcycle is needed for carrying the milk to the city. She demanded a motorcycle for A-2 to be purchased by PW-8. PW-8 did not accede to her demand and told A-1 that he was not in a position to purchase motorcycle as demanded by her. A-1 warned PW-8 that if he failed to provide a motorcycle to A- 2, then Kanta would not be allowed to stay in the matrimonial home. PW-8 called Amar Singh (PW-10) and Mam Chand (DW- 1) to his house and told them about the demand made by A-1. A-1 reiterated the demand and warning in their presence and left the house of PW-8. 2 3. This was the beginning of Kanta's end. A-1 and A- 2 started harassing and ill-treating her. Some five days prior to Rakshabandhan, A-2 brought Kanta to the house of PW-8. A-2 left Kanta there and returned to his house the same day. Kanta told PW-8 about harassment and ill-treatment being meted out to her by A-1 and A-2. Three days thereafter, A-2 went to the house of PW-8 and told him that he had come to take Kanta with him as there was engagement ceremony of his brother. A-2 assured PW-8 that he would bring Kanta on the day of Rakshabandhan. Kanta, however, was reluctant in going with A-2 as she knew that there was no engagement ceremony at her in-laws place. She had apprehension that if she went to her matrimonial home, her life would not be spared. PW-8 persuaded his daughter to go along with A-2 as she has to spend her entire life with him. 4. On the insistence of her father, Kanta went to her matrimonial home along with A-2. On the day of Rakshabandhan, PW-8 and the members of the family waited for Kanta for whole day but she did not come. After about eight days i.e. on August 12, 1990, PW-8 was informed by some 3 villager that Kanta was dead. PW-8 then went to the house of A-1 and A-2 along with few persons and saw the dead body of Kanta lying in a room. It appeared to PW-8 that Kanta's death had occurred some 2/3 days earlier. 5. Kanta's death having taken place in unnatural circumstances, PW-8 reported the matter to the police immediately and a First Information Report (FIR) was registered on that very day (August 12, 1990) at Police Station Ladwa under Section 304B IPC. Karnail Chand (PW-11) started investigation, visited the spot and also sent the dead body of Kanta for post-mortem. Dr. P.K. Goel (PW-1) conducted postmortem on the dead body of Kanta. Upon completion of investigation and after committal, A-1 and A-2 were sent up for trial under Section 304-B IPC. 6. Besides PW-1, PW-8, PW-10 and PW-11, the prosecution examined seven other witnesses including the deceased's mother Premo (PW-9). In defence, the accused examined DW-1 and Amarjit Kaur (DW-2). 4 7. The trial court vide its judgment dated March 6, 1991 held that the prosecution has been able to establish that the death of Kanta was within seven years of her marriage and otherwise than under normal circumstances; that before her death she was subjected to cruelty and harassment by A-1 and A-2 in connection with the demand of motorcycle and that A-1 and A-2 were guilty of causing dowry death. A-1 and A-2 were convicted under Section 304-B IPC accordingly and sentenced to suffer seven years' rigorous imprisonment as noticed above. The High Court in the appeal preferred by the appellants concurred with trial court and dismissed their appeal. 8. Mr. V. Madhukar, learned counsel for the appellants submitted that it was highly improbable that a demand for a motorcycle would be made from PW-8 knowing well that it could not be fulfilled by him as he was a Rikshawpuller earning Rs. 20/- per day. He argued that the evidence let in by the prosecution was not trustworthy at all and the demand for dowry is not established. He would submit that the only independent witness of demand was DW-1 but he was not examined by the prosecution. However, DW-1 was examined 5 in defence and he has denied that any demand was made by A-1 in his presence. 9. Learned counsel for the appellants argued that there was no evidence of demand of motorcycle by A-2. He further argued that in any case the demand of motorcycle for the purposes of the business does not qualify as a `demand for dowry' and, therefore, no offence under Section 304-B IPC can be said to have been made out against the appellants. In this regard, he relied upon a decision of this Court in Appasaheb & Anr. v. State of Maharashtra1 . 10. On the other hand, Mr. Kamal Mohan Gupta, learned counsel for the State of Haryana, supported the judgment of the High Court. 11. Section 304B was inserted in IPC with effect from November 19, 1986 by the Dowry Prohibition (Amendment) Act, 1986 (for short, `(Amendment) Act, 1986'). Thereby substantive offence relating to `dowry death' was introduced in the IPC . Section 304-B IPC reads as follows : ""304B. Dowry death.--(1) Where the death of a woman is caused by any burns or bodily injury or occurs otherwise than under normal 1 (2007) 9 SCC 721 6 circumstances within seven years of her marriage and it is shown that soon before her death she was subjected to cruelty or harassment by her husband or any relative of her husband for, or in connection with, any demand for dowry, such death shall be called ""dowry death"", and such husband or relative shall be deemed to have caused her death. Explanation.- For the purposes of this sub- section,"" dowry"" shall have the same meaning as in section 2 of the Dowry Prohibition Act, 1961 (28 of 1961 ). (2) Whoever commits dowry death shall be punished with imprisonment for a term which shall not be less than seven years but which may extend to imprisonment for life."" 12. For making out an offence of `dowry death' under Section 304B, the following ingredients have to be proved by the prosecution: (a) death of a woman must have been caused by any burns or bodily injury or her death must have occurred otherwise than under normal circumstances; (b) such death must have occurred within seven years of her marriage; (c) soon before her death, she must have been subjected to cruelty or harassment by her husband or any relative of her husband; and (d) such cruelty or harassment must be in connection with the demand for dowry. 7 13. Pertinently, for the purposes of Section 304B IPC, `dowry' has the same meaning as in Section 2 of the Dowry Prohibition Act, 1961 (for short, `1961 Act'). 14. Section 2 of the 1961 Act defines `Dowry' as follows: ""2. Definition of `dowry'.- ""Dowry"" means any property or valuable security given or agreed to be given either directly or indirectly-- (a) By one party to a marriage to the other party to the marriage; or (b) By the parent of either party to a marriage or by any other person to either party to the marriage or to any other person, at or before or any time after the marriage in connection with the marriage of the said parties, but does not include dower or mahr in the case of persons to whom the Muslim Personal Law (Shariat) applies. Explanation I--............(Omitted). Explanation II--The expression ""valuable security"" has the same meaning as in section 30 of the Indian Penal Code (45 of 1860)."" 15. 1961 Act was enacted to prohibit the giving or taking of `dowry' and for the protection of married woman against cruelty and violence in the matrimonial home by the husband and in-laws. The mere demand for `dowry' before 8 marriage, at the time of marriage or any time after the marriage is an offence. 1961 Act has been amended by the Parliament on more than one occasion and by the (Amendment) Act, 1986, Parliament brought in stringent provisions and provided for offence relating to `dowry death'. The amendments became imperative as the dowry deaths continued to increase to disturbing proportions and the existing provisions in 1961 Act were found inadequate in dealing with the problems of dowry deaths. The definition of `dowry' reproduced above would show that the term is defined comprehensively to include properties of all sorts as it takes within its fold `any property or valuable security' given or agreed to be given in connection with marriage either directly or indirectly. In S. Gopal Reddy v. State of A.P.2 , this Court stated as follows : ""9. The definition of the term `dowry' under Section 2 of the Act shows that any property or valuable security given or ""agreed to be given"" either directly or indirectly by one party to the marriage to the other party to the marriage ""at or before or after the marriage"" as a ""consideration for the marriage of the said parties"" would become `dowry' punishable under the Act. Property or valuable security so as to constitute `dowry' within the meaning of the Act must 2 (1996) 4 SCC 596 9 therefore be given or demanded ""as consideration for the marriage"". .................................................................. 11. The definition of the expression `dowry' contained in Section 2 of the Act cannot be confined merely to the `demand' of money, property or valuable security ""made at or after the performance of marriage"" as is urged by Mr Rao. The legislature has in its wisdom while providing for the definition of `dowry' emphasised that any money, property or valuable security given, as a consideration for marriage, ""before, at or after"" the marriage would be covered by the expression `dowry' and this definition as contained in Section 2 has to be read wherever the expression `dowry' occurs in the Act. Meaning of the expression `dowry' as commonly used and understood is different than the peculiar definition thereof under the Act. Under Section 4 of the Act, mere demand of `dowry' is sufficient to bring home the offence to an accused. Thus, any `demand' of money, property or valuable security made from the bride or her parents or other relatives by the bridegroom or his parents or other relatives or vice versa would fall within the mischief of `dowry' under the Act where such demand is not properly referable to any legally recognised claim and is relatable only to the consideration of marriage. Marriage in this context would include a proposed marriage also more particularly where the non- fulfilment of the ""demand of dowry"" leads to the ugly consequence of the marriage not taking place at all. The expression `dowry' under the Act must be interpreted in the sense which the statute wishes to attribute to it...............The definition given in the statute is the determinative factor. The Act is a piece of social legislation which aims to check the growing menace of the social evil of dowry and it makes punishable not only the actual receiving of dowry but also the very demand of dowry made before or at the time or after the 10 marriage where such demand is referable to the consideration of marriage. Dowry as a quid pro quo for marriage is prohibited .......... ."". 16. While dealing with the term `dowry' in Section 304B IPC, this Court in the case of Kamesh Panjiyar @ Kamlesh Panjiyar v. State of Bihar3 held as under : ""14. The word ""dowry"" in Section 304-B IPC has to be understood as it is defined in Section 2 of the Dowry Act. Thus, there are three occasions related to dowry. One is before the marriage, second is at the time of marriage and the third ""at any time"" after the marriage. The third occasion may appear to be unending period. But the crucial words are ""in connection with the marriage of the said parties"". As was observed in the said case ""suicidal death"" of a married woman within seven years of her marriage is covered by the expression ""death of a woman is caused ... or occurs otherwise than under normal circumstances"" as expressed in Section 304-B IPC."" 17. Learned counsel for the appellants heavily relied upon the following observations made by this Court in the case of Appasaheb1: ""A demand for money on account of some financial stringency or for meeting some urgent domestic expenses or for purchasing manure cannot be termed as a demand for dowry as the said word is normally understood"". 3 (2005) 2 SCC 388 11 The above observations of this Court must be understood in the context of the case. That was a case wherein the prosecution evidence did not show `any demand for dowry' as defined in Section 2 of the 1961 Act. The allegation to the effect that the deceased was asked to bring money for domestic expenses and for purchasing manure in the facts of the case was not found sufficient to be covered by the `demand for dowry'. Appasaheb1 cannot be read to be laying down an absolute proposition that a demand for money or some property or valuable security on account of some business or financial requirement could not be termed as `demand for dowry'. It was in the facts of the case that it was held so. If a demand for property or valuable security, directly or indirectly, has a nexus with marriage, in our opinion, such demand would constitute `demand for dowry'; the cause or reason for such demand being immaterial. 18. In the backdrop of the above legal position, if we look at the facts of the case, it is clearly established that Kanta died otherwise than under normal circumstances. There is no dispute of fact that death of Kanta occurred within seven years 12 of her marriage. That Kanta was subjected to harassment and ill-treatment by A-1 and A-2 after PW-8 refused to accede to their demand for purchase of motorcycle is established by the evidence of PW-8 and PW-9. Then there is evidence of PW-10 that PW-8 had called him and DW-1 to his house where A-1 had made demand of motorcycle. PW-10 stated that he sought to reason to A-1 about inability of PW-8 to give motorcycle at which A-1 got angry and warned that Kanta would not be allowed to stay in her matrimonial home. It is true that the appellants produced DW-1 in defence and he did state in his examination-in-chief that he did not meet A-1 at the house of PW-8 but in cross-examination when he was confronted with his statement under Section 161 Cr.P.C. (portion A to A) where it was recorded that he and PW-10 had gone to the house of PW-8 and both of them (PW-10 and DW-1) counselled A-1 to desist from demanding motorcycle but she stuck to her demand, DW-1 had no explanation to offer. The evidence of DW-1 is, therefore, liable to be discarded. In light of the evidence let in by the prosecution, the trial court cannot be said to have erred in holding that it was established that unlawful 13 demand of motorcycle was made by A-1 and A-2 from PW-8 and Kanta was harassed on account of his failure to provide the motorcycle and that led Kanta to commit suicide by hanging. Pertinently, the demand of motorcycle by A-1 from PW-8 was for A-2 and when PW-8 showed his inability to meet that demand, A-2 started harassing and ill-treating Kanta. In this view of the matter, it cannot be said that there was no demand by A-2. 19. The High Court has also examined the matter thoroughly and reached the finding that A-1 and A-2 had raised a demand for purchase of motorcycle from PW-8; this demand was made within two months of the marriage and was a demand towards `dowry' and when this demand was not met, Kanta was maltreated and harassed continuously which led her to take extreme step of finishing her life. We agree with the above view of the High Court. There is no merit in the contention of the counsel for the appellants that the demand of motorcycle does not qualify as a `demand for dowry'. All the essential ingredients to bring home the guilt under Section 304B IPC are established against the appellants by the 14 prosecution evidence. As a matter of law, the presumption under Section 113B of the Evidence Act, 1872 is fully attracted in the facts and circumstances of the present case. The appellants have failed to rebut the presumption under Section 113B. 20. For the foregoing reasons, we find no merit in the appeal and it is dismissed accordingly. Two months' time is given to A-1 to surrender for undergoing the sentence awarded to her. .................... J. (Aftab Alam) .................... J. (R.M. Lodha) NEW DELHI, FEBRUARY 8, 2011. 15"

Jain Bench: H.L. Dattu , Asok Kumar Ganguly , D.K. Jain REPORTABLE IN THE SUPREME COURT OF INDIA CIVIL APPELLATE JURISDICTION CIVIL APPEAL NO. 3788 OF 2003 M/S. MUSTAN TAHERBHAI -- APPELLANT VERSUS COMMNR. OF CENTRAL EXCISE & -- RESPONDENT CUSTOMS J U D G M E N T D.K. JAIN, J.: 1. This appeal, under Section 130E of the Customs Act, 1962 (for short ""the Act""), is directed against order dated 18th February, 2003, passed by the Customs, Excise & Gold (Control) Appellate Tribunal, as it existed at the relevant time, (for short ""the Tribunal""). By the impugned order the Tribunal has dismissed the appeal filed by the appellant herein and confirmed the levy of customs duty on the ocean going vessel, registered 1 as M.V. Jagat Priya, purchased by them in a Court auction, for breaking/ scrapping purpose in terms of Notification No. 133/87-Cus. 2. M.V. Jagat Priya was manufactured by M/s. Hindustan Shipyard Ltd. in the year 1975 in a Customs Bonded Warehouse at Vishakapatanam, using certain imported items. The said vessel was cleared on 30th November, 1975, and was delivered to M/s. Dempo Steamship Ltd. for a consideration of `7,61,12,400/- and Central Excise duty at the rate of 1% was paid thereon. The vessel was registered as Indian vessel tonnage and flying an Indian flag. However, it ceased to ply and was grounded at Bedi Bunder, Jamnagar, in June 1986. On 16th October, 1992, an order was passed by the High Court of Judicature at Bombay in Admiralty suit at the instance of Union of India and the Shipping Credit and Investment Co. of India Ltd. for auction of the vessel on ""as is where is"" basis ""free from all encumbrances and existing liens"". 3. On 12th February, 1993, the vessel was auctioned and being the highest bidder, the appellant viz. M/s. Mustan Taherbhai purchased the vessel. The sale in favour of the appellant was confirmed by the High Court and in furtherance thereof, the possession of the ship was delivered on 4th March, 1993. Thereafter, on 10th May, 1993, on the direction of the Superintendent of Central Excise & Customs, the appellant filed a bill of 2 entry claiming that the ship was an Indian built ship, and therefore, no customs duty was payable. On 12th May, 1993, the Superintendent of Central Excise, Jamnagar passed a provisional assessment order demanding customs duty @ 5%, and an additional duty of `1000/- per LDT. 4. Being aggrieved, the appellant preferred Special Civil Application No. 4924 of 1993 before the High Court of Gujarat. The High Court, vide interim order dated 25th May, 1993, permitted the appellant to clear the materials obtained by breaking the ship in question without payment of provisional duty on the condition that the appellant will file a bond with security deposit. Vide order dated 23rd July, 1993, the High Court disposed of the said application, and directed the appellant to file an appeal before the Commissioner (Appeals). Accordingly, the appellant preferred an appeal before the Commissioner (Appeals). 5. The Commissioner (Appeals), vide order dated 29th April, 1994, dismissed the appeal and confirmed the order of provisional assessment dated 12th May, 1993. 6. Being aggrieved, the appellant preferred an appeal before the Tribunal. Vide order dated 10th July, 1998 the Tribunal dismissed the appeal. 3 Relying on the decision of this Court in Union of India & Ors. Vs. M/s. Jalyan Udyog & Anr.1, the Tribunal observed that Notification No. 133/87-Cus was applicable in the instant case, and therefore, the appellant was liable to pay customs duty on the vessel at the rate prevalent at the time of breaking of ship. 7. Being dissatisfied, the appellant preferred an application under Section 129(B)(2) of the Act praying for rectification of mistakes in the order, dated 10th July, 1998, on the ground that the Tribunal had erroneously concluded that: (i) the goods manufactured in a customs bonded warehouse were similar to goods imported under the Act; (ii) the issue for determination before it was whether Notification No. 133/87-Cus was applicable or not, whereas the real issue for determination was whether the vessel was imported or indigenously manufactured; (iii) the customs duty under Notification No. 133/87-Cus was payable when Notification No. 118/59-Cus was applicable; (iv) since the vessel was subsequently being broken up, its clearance would be governed by Notification No. 262/58-Cus; and (v) the decision in Jalyan Udyog (supra) was applicable to the facts of the present case. 1 (1994) 1 SCC 318 4 8. Vide order dated 13th April, 1999, the Tribunal dismissed the said application on the ground that it is a settled position that goods manufactured in a customs bonded warehouse are treated akin to goods manufactured in a foreign country, and when the vessel was taken out of the country for plying as foreign going vessel, and subsequently, the said vessel is brought back to India for breaking purposes, it amounts to re- import. 9. Aggrieved, the appellant preferred yet another application under Section 129(B)(2) of the Act for rectification of mistakes in the order of the Tribunal dated 13th April, 1999 on the ground that in Union of India Vs. Baijnath Melaram2, this Court had affirmed the Bombay High Court's decision wherein it was held that no customs duty was payable on vessels which are subject to breaking, if the said vessels had been manufactured in India. Vide order dated 8th October, 1999, the Tribunal dismissed the said application as well, holding that it had correctly relied on the decision of this Court in Jalyan Udyog (supra). 10.Still aggrieved, the appellant preferred C.A. No. 1998 of 2000 before this Court. Vide order dated 30th August, 2001, this Court, while remanding the matter back to the Tribunal, observed thus: 2 1998 (97) ELT 27 (SC) 5 ""It appears from the judgment of the Tribunal that the matter was argued without reference to facts which are now stated in the special leave petition, namely, that the vessel was built in India and excise duty was paid thereon at the time of its clearance. It was delivered to an Indian party. The contention on these facts is that this was not a transaction of export and import which would render the appellants liable to the payment of customs duty. Reliance by the Tribunal upon the decision of this Court in the case of Union of India & Ors. vs. Jalyan Udyog & Ors. (1994 (1) S.C.C. 318) would be misplaced if these are, indeed, the facts for that was not a case that related to a vessel that was built in India and cleared for home consumption. We think it appropriate, in the circumstances, that the order under challenge should be set aside and the matter be remanded to the Tribunal to be considered afresh. In so doing, the Tribunal shall determine, first, the facts and then the law. The Tribunal may take note of the judgment of the Bombay High Court delivered on 5th February, 1992 in the case of M/s. Baijnath Melaram vs. Union of India & Ors. (Writ Petition No.1478 of 1983), special leave petitions whereagainst were summarily dismissed. It may be noted that we express no opinion on the merits of the case on either side."" It is plain from a bare reading of the said order that this Court had directed the Tribunal to first appreciate the facts of the case and then determine the question of leviability of import duty on an Indian built ship which was sold for breaking. It is evident from the afore-extracted paragraph that the Court had observed that reliance by the Tribunal on the decision of this Court in Jalyan Udyog (supra) would be misplaced. 6 11.Accordingly, the Tribunal re-considered the matter. As stated above, vide the impugned order, the Tribunal has dismissed the appeal, observing thus: ""The fact that Notification No. 118/59-Cus. was not in existence at the date on which the vessel was cleared by HSL having been superseded by Notification No. 163/65-Cus. came to light only on the submissions made by Shri Pundir. It would appear that at all times it was wrongly presumed that the earlier Notification was in existence. We do not see the revelation as bringing on record new facts. We see it as correction of the factual error, which had existed in the record at all times. We find no substance in the submissions of Shri Doiphode, that a new case is being made out by the Revenue at the present stage. 14. It has been held by the Hon'ble Supreme Court that as far as facts are concerned, the Tribunal is the final authority and the Court would go into only the questions of law at the appeal stage. Therefore, the Tribunal would first record the correct facts and then in the factual perspective would locate and apply the relevant law. 15. When the fact is accepted that Notification 118/59-Cus. did not exist at the time of clearance of the vessel from the Shipyard, the persistent plea that the ship was manufactured in the warehouse and that it was manufactured in India and that it attracted excise duty alone need not be considered at all. Since on the date of such clearance, the notification in force was 113/83-Cus., the provisions thereof would apply and the duty would be payable in terms of the conditions in the said notification. 16. Since we have so held the question of the applicability of the High Court judgment in the case of Baijnath Melaram does not arise."" 12.Hence, the present appeal. 7 13.Mr. Joseph Vellapally, learned senior counsel appearing on behalf of the appellant, strenuously urged that in the instant case the imported goods lost their identity when they were used in the manufacture of vessel along with domestically procured goods, and were cleared as such, and therefore, the revenue cannot claim on the one breath that the ship was ""manufactured"" in India and attracted excise duty at the time of clearance and on the other breath cannot contend that the ship was manufactured abroad and was exigible to levy of customs duty when it is to be cleared for breaking at an Indian coast. Learned counsel urged that once excise duty has been levied and paid on goods, there is no question of levy of customs duty under Section 3 of the Customs Tariff Act, 1975 as the latter is meant to neutralize the non-levy of excise duty. 14.Learned counsel contended that Section 21 of the erstwhile Sea Customs Act, 1878 provided that when any article liable to duty forms part or ingredient of a good, then such good would be liable to full duty as if it was entirely composed of such article. In the absence of such a charging provision in the Act, ships manufactured by Hindustan Shipyard in India cannot be subjected to customs duty at the time of clearance for home consumption. Relying on the decisions of this Court in The State of 8 Tamil Nadu Vs. M.K. Kandaswami & Ors.3 and In Re. Sea Customs Act, 1878 S. 20 .4, learned counsel submitted that no customs duty was chargeable in the instant case, in as much as the ship was not a ""taxable good"" as it was not imported as defined under Section 2(25) of the Act. Moreover, there was no ""taxable event"" as there was no import in the instant case, and the appellant being an auction-purchaser cannot be likened to an importer under the Act. Relying on the decision of this Court in Baijnath Melaram (supra), learned counsel urged that no customs duty can be levied on Indian built ships. Learned counsel asserted that the Tribunal had not complied with the order of this Court dated 30th August, 2001 in as much as it has failed to consider the judgment of the Bombay High Court in M/s. Baijnath Melaram Vs. Union of India & Ors. (W.P. 1478 of 1983), nor has it determined the question of liability to import duty of an Indian built ship, after evaluating the factual background of the case as was specifically directed. Relying on the decision of this court in Hyderabad Industries Ltd. & Anr. Vs. Union of India & Ors.5 , learned counsel urged that even if it is held that customs duty is payable in the instant case, no additional customs duty is leviable as excise duty had already been paid. 3 (1975) 4 SCC 745 4 (1964) 3 SCR 787 5 (1999) 5 SCC 15 9 15.Per contra, Mr. Hairsh Chander, learned senior counsel appearing on behalf of the Revenue, while supporting the impugned judgment, contended that at the time of clearance of the ship, Notification No. 118/59-Cus was not in force, as the same had been superseded by Notification No. 163/65-Cus. At the time the appellant presented the bill of entry, however, Notification No. 133/87-Cus was in force, as rightly concluded by the Tribunal. 16.Learned counsel urged that when a ship is manufactured in a bonded warehouse, for all purposes, it is deemed to be manufactured in a foreign country, and by virtue of Notification No. 133/87-Cus, a legal fiction is created whereby when the ship manufactured in a bonded warehouse is brought to India for breaking purposes, it is deemed to be manufactured in a foreign country and appropriate duty has to be paid for clearance for ship breaking. Learned counsel contended that the said Notification is clear, and admits of no ambiguity, and it is settled that when a fiction is created by law, the Courts must give full effect to the fiction. Learned counsel urged that in terms of the Notification and as was observed by this Court in Jalyan Udyog (supra), the date relevant for determining the value and rate of the customs duty chargeable is the date on which the ship is broken up, which should be reckoned as the date on which 1 permission for breaking up is accorded by the Director General of Shipping. Learned counsel submitted that the fact that the appellant was an auction-purchaser is inconsequential in as much as Notification No. 133/87-Cus was a conditional notification, viz. when the ship is broken, customs duty as prevalent on the date of breaking will have to be paid, and therefore, customs duty was required to be paid in terms of Sections 12 and 15 read with Section 68 of the Act. Learned counsel also argued that Section 68 of the Act makes it clear that when the importer of any warehoused goods intends to clear them for home consumption, then a bill of entry for home consumption has be to be filed, and the import duty leviable on such goods has to be paid by the importer, as was held in D.C.M. & Anr. Vs. Union of India & Anr. 6. Learned counsel submitted that Section 9 of the Act makes it clear that clearance from a Bonded warehouse is to be treated as an import into India. It was also stressed that clearance of vessel was in terms of the exemption notification, which stipulated payment of appropriate customs duty prevalent at the time of its breaking. Reliance was placed on the decisions of this Court in Hansraj Gordhandas Vs. H.H. Dave, Assistant Collector of Central Excise & Customs, Surat & Ors.7 ; Novopan India Ltd., Hyderabad Vs. 6 1995 Supp (3) SCC 223 7 (1969) 2 SCR 253 1 Collector of Central Excise And Customs, Hyderabad8 and Commissioner of Central Excise and Customs, Indore Vs. Parenteral Drugs India Ltd.9 to contend that the terms of an exemption notification have to be construed strictly. 17.Having bestowed our anxious consideration, we are constrained to hold that the impugned judgment deserves to be set aside on the short ground that while deciding the case, the Tribunal has ignored the specific directions issued by this Court, vide order dated 30th August, 2001. It is evident from the impugned order, in particular from paras 15 and 16 that the Tribunal has not appreciated the facts obtaining in the present case in their correct perspective, which has resulted in vitiating its decision on the question of leviability of import duty. Although, from para 14 of the impugned order it is evident that the Tribunal was conscious of the direction of this Court that it was required to first record the correct facts and then in the factual perspective locate and apply the relevant law, yet in the very next paragraph it proceeds to hold that when it is accepted that Notification No. 118/59-Cus. did not exist at the time of clearance of the vessel from the ship yard, the persistent plea that the ship was manufactured in a warehouse located in India and therefore, it attracted 8 1994 Supp (3) SCC 606 9 (2009) 14 SCC 342 1 excise duty alone need not be considered at all. In our opinion, in light of the decision and directions of this Court in C.A. 1998 of 2000, judicial discipline obliged the Tribunal to examine the entire legal issue after ascertaining the foundational facts, regardless of its earlier view in the matter. Therefore, the decision of the Tribunal cannot be sustained. 18.We are thus, convinced that it is a fit case which should be remanded back to the Tribunal for fresh adjudication and determination of the question of leviability of import duty on an Indian-built ship brought into India for breaking purpose. For the view we have taken, we deem it unnecessary to deal with other contentions urged by the learned counsel. 19.Resultantly, the appeal is allowed; the impugned order is set aside, and the matter is remanded back to the Tribunal for fresh consideration, in accordance with law, bearing in mind the observations of this Court in C.A. No. 1998 of 2000. There will, however, be no order as to costs. ................................................. (D.K. JAIN, J.) 1 .................................................
