Haryana in Criminal Misc. No.10664-M of 2007 quashing a 



criminal proceeding against respondents Nos. 1 and 2.



3.    The relevant facts briefly are that on 12.12.2004, F.I.R. 



No.276   was   registered     at   Police   Station   Sadar,   District

                                    2





(for short `the 
IPC
') on information furnished by respondent 



No.1.  The allegations in the F.I.R. were that on 12.12.2004, 



at   about   8.00   a.m.,   the   respondent   No.1   and   his   mother 



were on their plot of land and they had engaged mason and 



labours   for   erecting   walls   on   the   plot   when   the   appellant 



with  others  came  armed with weapons  and started   beating 



the   respondent   No.1   and   his   mother   and   as   a   result   the 



respondent No.1 and his mother suffered injuries and were 



admitted in the hospital.  On 13.12.2004, the appellant gave 



a   different   version   of   the   incident   on   12.12.2004   to   the 



police   alleging   that   when   he   along   with   his   father   Mohan 



Singh reached the plot, they saw the respondent Nos. 1 and 



2   along   with   others   erecting   walls   on   the   plot   and   when 



Mohan Singh stopped the mason saying that the plot was a 



disputed one, respondent no.2 gave a lalkara and all others 



attacked Mohan Singh and the appellant caused injuries on 



them   and   as   a   result   they   have   been   admitted   to   the 



hospital.  After investigation, the police filed two challans on 



02.02.2006   before   the   Judicial   Magistrate,   First   Class, 



Ludhiana.     Under   one   challan,   the   appellant,   his   father 



Mohan Singh and Bhupinder Singh were charge-sheeted for

application   to   the   Additional   Director   General   of   Police, 



Crime   Branch,   Punjab,   pursuant   to   which   the   prosecution 



moved   an   application   before   the   Judicial   Magistrate,   First 



Class on 19.07.2006 for permission to investigate further in 



the   case   and   on   27.07.2006   the   Judicial   Magistrate,   First 



Class,   Ludhiana,   granted   such   permission   to   the 



prosecution.



4.     After   further   investigation,   the   Superintendent   of 



Police, City-II, Ludhiana, submitted his report to the Deputy 



Inspector  General of  Police,  Ludhiana Range.   The  relevant 



portion of the report of the Superintendent of Police, City-II, 



Ludhiana,   which   contains   his   conclusions   after   further 



investigation, is extracted hereinbelow:



      "I   found   during   my   investigation   that   Mohan 

      Singh, son of Shri Sher Singh , Dharmatma Singh,

Harminder   Singh   @   Hindri,   son   of   Shri   Harnek

this   plot   by   employing   labours   and   mason   and 

while   so   in   the   meantime   Dharmatma   Sigh, 

Bhupinder   Singh,   sons   of   Mohan   Singh   and 

Mohan   Singh   came   present   on   this   plot   and   they 

stopped   forcibly   Harminder   Singh   not   to   erect   4 

walls and when Harminder Singh @ Hindri did not 

stop,   they   started   beating   Harminder   Singh   @

Singh,   Bharpur   Singh,   son   of   Balbir   Singh   also

hearing   the   raula   of   Harminder   Singh   @   Hindri

Dharmatma Singh also got some injuries and as a

324

   IPC   is   made   out.     Since   Dharmatama 

Singh,   Bhupinder   Singh   and   Mohan   Singh   while 

entering   into   the   house   of   Harminder   Singh   @ 

Hindri   gave   injury   to   Harminder   Singh   @   Hindri 

and   the   aforesaid   Harminder   Singh   for   his   self 

defence   gave   some   injuries   to   Dharmatma   Singh 

etc. and the same shall come under the definition 

of  self   defence   and,  therefore,   no  proceeding/case

      can be initiated against Harminder Singh @ Hindri 

      party   and   therefore,   the   cross   case   as   registered 

      against   Harminder   Singh   @   Hindri   party   is 

      required   to   be   cancelled.     And   if   your   goodself 

      agree   with   the   report,   please   necessary   orders   be

                                                       (D. P. Singh)

                                            S.          P.         City-II, 

      Ludhiana"




It will be clear from the aforesaid extract from the report of 



further   investigation   that   Superintendent   of   Police,   City   II, 



Ludhiana,   was   of   the   opinion   that   respondent   No.1   gave 



some   injuries   to   the   appellant   and   others   for   his   self-



defence and such injuries come under the definition of right 



of   private   defence   and,   therefore,   no   proceedings   could   be 



initiated   against   respondent   No.1   and   the   case   registered 



against respondent No.1 should be cancelled. 




5.     The   Deputy   Inspector   General   of   Police,   Ludhiana 



Range,   to   whom   the   aforesaid   report   was   submitted, 



referred   the   matter   to   the   Additional   Director   General   of 



Police,   Crime   Branch,   Punjab,   Chandigarh,   and   the 



Additional Director General of Police was of the opinion that 



as   the   challans   had   already   been   filed   against   the 



respondents   in   the   cross-case,   the   decision   of   the   case 



                                           6





should   be   left   to   the   Court.     The   opinion   of   the   Additional 



Director General of Police as stated in his communication to 



the   Deputy   Inspector   General   of   Police,   Ludhiana   Range, 



Ludhiana, is quoted herein below:



          "After   thoroughly   investigating   this   case, 

          finding   has   already   been   recorded   at 

          ADGP/Crime              level         that         Man      Singh, 

          Harminder Singh party did not cause injuries 

          to   other   party   in   self   defence.     In   the   main 

          case   and   cross   case,   challan   has   already 

          been presented in the court.     During further 

          investigation,   no   new   evidence   came   on 

          record.   In other words, report of S.P. City I, 

          Ludhiana is not based on any such evidence 

          which was not available at the time of inquiry 

          conducted by the Crime Wing.   So, the cross 

          case   does   not   deserve   to   be   cancelled.     By 

          ignoring the above report, decision of the case 

          should be left to the court.





                                                 Sd/-





                        For   Addl.   Director   General   of 

          Police,

                        Crime, Punjab, Chandigarh"





6.    However,   before   the   Court   of   the   Judicial   Magistrate, 



First   Class,   Ludhiana,   could   apply   its   mind   and   take   a 



decision   on   the   original   challan   against   respondents   No.   1 



and   2   and   on   the   report   of   further   investigation 



recommending dropping of the criminal proceedings against 



                                     7





them,   respondent   Nos.   1   and   2   filed   Criminal   Misc. 



Application No.10664-M of 2007 under Section 482 Cr.P.C. 



on   17.02.2007   in   the   High   Court   of   Punjab   and   Haryana 



praying   for   quashing   of   DDR   No.15   dated   13.12.2004   and 



the challan filed against them by the police in the Court of 



Judicial   Magistrate,   First   Class.     After   considering   the 



report   of   further   investigation   recommending   dropping   of 



the   criminal   proceedings   against   respondent   No.1   and 



others,   the   High   Court   passed   the   impugned   order   dated 



25.03.2008   quashing   the   criminal   proceedings   initiated 



pursuant   to   the   DDR   No.15   dated   13.12.2004   and   further 



directing that the criminal proceedings against the appellant 



at   the   behest   of   the   respondent   No.1   initiated   pursuant   to 



the F.I.R. No. 276 dated 12.12.2004 shall not be affected.



7.    Learned   counsel   for   the   appellant   submitted   that   the 



power   under   
Section   482
   of   the   Cr.P.C.   is   to   be   exercised 



only   in   the   exceptional   circumstances   and   that   the   High 



Court   should   not   have   exercised   this   power   and   quashed 



the criminal proceedings against the respondents No.1 and 



2 when the Magistrate was yet to exercise his judicial mind 



under   
Section   190
   of  the   Cr.P.C.   to  the  police   reports   filed 



                                    8





under   
Section   173
   of   the   Cr.P.C.     He   submitted   that   the 



Magistrate   before   whom   the   entire   records   were   placed 



including   the   evidence   collected   during   the   investigation 



was   in   a   better   position   to   appreciate   the   facts   and 



circumstances of the case and pass orders whether to take 



cognizance of the offences against the respondents No.1 and 



2   registered  pursuant   to   the   DDR   No.15   dated   13.12.2004 



on   the   basis   of   information   furnished   by   the   appellant. 



Learned   counsel   for   the   respondent   Nos.   1   and   2,   on   the 



other   hand,   relied   on   the   report   of   the   Superintendent   of 



Police,   City-II,   Ludhiana,   recommending   dropping   of   the 



criminal   proceedings   against   them   and   supported   the 



impugned   order   passed   by   the   High   Court   quashing   the 



criminal proceedings against them.



8.     For   deciding   the   issue,   we   must   first   refer   to   the 



provisions   of   
Section   173
   of   the   Cr.P.C.   under   which   the 



police   submits   reports   after   investigation   and   after   further 



investigation,   
Section   190
   of   the   Cr.   P.C.   under   which   the 



Magistrate   takes   cognizance   of   an   offence   upon   a   police 



report and 
Section 482
 of the Cr.P.C. under which the High 



Court   exercises   its   powers   to   quash   the   criminal 



                                      9

Cr.P.C
.   are 



extracted below:

     released   on  his  bond,  the   Magistrate   shall  make 

     such   order-   for   the   discharge   of   such   bond   or 

     otherwise as he thinks fit.



     (5)   When   such   report   is   in   respect   of   a   case   to 

     which 
section 170
 applies, the police officer shall 

     forward to the Magistrate alongwith the report-



          (a)   all   documents   or   relevant   extracts 

          thereof   on   which   the   prosecution 

          proposes   to   rely   other   than   those 

          already   sent   to   the   Magistrate   during 

          investigation;



          (b)   the   statements-recorded   under 

          
section 161
 of all the persons whom the 

          prosecution   proposes   to   examine   as   its 

          witnesses.



     (6) If the police officer is of opinion that any part 

     of   any   such   statement   is   not   relevant   to   the 



                                  11





subject-matter   of   the   proceedings   or   that   its 

disclosure   to   the   accused   is   not   essential   in   the 

interests   of   justice   and   is   inexpedient   in   the 

public interest, he shall indicate that part of the 

statement   and   append   a   note   requesting   the 

Magistrate to exclude that part from the copies to 

be granted to the accused and stating his reasons 

for making such request.



(7) Where the police officer investigating the case 

finds   it   convenient   so   to   do,   he   may   furnish   to 

the accused copies of all or any of the documents 

referred to in sub-section (5).



(8)   Nothing   in   this   section   shall   be   deemed   to 

preclude   further   investigation   in   respect   of   an 

offence   after   a   report   under   subsection   (2)   has 

been   forwarded   to   the   Magistrate   and,   where 

upon   such   investigation,   the   officer   in   charge   of 

the   police   station   obtains   further   evidence,   oral 

or   documentary,   he   shall   forward   to   the 

Magistrate   a   further   report   or   reports   regarding 

such   evidence   in   the   form   prescribed   ;   and   the 

provisions   of   sub-sections   (2)   to   (6)   shall,   as   far 

as   may   be,   apply   in   relation   to   such   report   or 

reports   as   they   apply   in   relation   to   a   report 

forwarded under sub-section (2).



190.  Cognizance   of   offences   by   Magistrate.   - 



(1) Subject to the provisions of this Chapter, any 

Magistrate   of   the   first   class,   and   any   Magistrate 

of   the   second   class   specially   empowered   in   this 

behalf   under   sub-section   (2),   may   take 

cognizance of any offence-



     (a)   upon   receiving   a   complaint   of   facts 

     which constitute such offence;



     (b) upon a police report of such facts;



     (c)   upon   information   received   from   any 

     person   other   than   a   police   officer,   or 



                                      12





              upon   his   own   knowledge,   that   such 

              offence has been committed.



      (2)   The   Chief   Judicial   Magistrate   may   empower 

      any   Magistrate   of   the   second   class   to   take 

      cognizance under sub-section (1) of such offences 

      as   are   within   his   competence   to   inquire   into   or 

      try.



      482. Saving of inherent power of High Court.- 



      Nothing in this Code shall be deemed to limit  or 

      affect   the   inherent   powers   of   the   High   Court   to 

      make   such   orders   as   may   be   necessary   to   give 

      effect to any order under this Code, or to prevent 

      abuse of the process of any Court or otherwise to 

      secure the ends of justice."



9.     A   reading   of   provisions   of   sub-section   (2)   of   
Section 



173
, Cr.P.C. would show that as soon as the investigation is 



completed,   the   officer   in   charge   of   the   police   station   is 



required   to   forward   the   police   report   to   the   Magistrate 



empowered   to   take   cognizance   of   the   offence   stating  inter  



alia  whether   an   offence   appears   to   have   been   committed 



and if so, by whom.   Sub-section (8) of 
Section 173
 further 



provides that where upon further investigation, the officer in 



charge of the police station obtains further evidence, oral or 



documentary,   he   shall   also   forward   to   the   Magistrate   a 



further report regarding such evidence and the provisions of 



sub-section (2) of 
Section 173
, Cr.P.C., shall, as far as may 



be, apply in relation to such report or reports as they apply 



                                      13





in   relation   to   a   report   forwarded   under   sub-section   (2). 



Thus,  the report under  sub-section (2) of 
Section  173
 after 



the   initial   investigation   as  well   as  the   further   report  under 



sub-section   (8)   of   
Section   173
   after   further   investigation 



constitute   "police   report"   and   have   to   be   forwarded   to   the 



Magistrate empowered to take cognizance of the offence.   It 



will also be clear from 
Section 190 (b)
 of the Cr.P.C. that it 



is the Magistrate, who has the power to take cognizance of 



any   offence   upon   a   "police   report"   of   such   facts   which 



constitute   an   offence.     Thus,   when   a   police   report   is 



forwarded  to the Magistrate either  under sub-section (2) or 



under   sub-section   (8)   of   
Section   173
,   Cr.P.C.,   it   is   for   the 



Magistrate to apply his mind to the police report and take a 



view whether to take cognizance of an offence or not to take 



cognizance of offence against an accused person. 



10.     It follows that where the police report forwarded to the 



Magistrate under 
Section 173 (2)
 of the Cr.P.C. states that a 



person has committed an offence, but after investigation the 



further   report   under   
Section   173   (8)
   of   the   Cr.P.C.   states 



that the person has not committed the offence, it is for the 



Magistrate to form an opinion whether the facts, set out in 



                                     14





the   two   reports,   make   out   an   offence   committed   by   the 



person.     This   interpretation   has   given   by   this   Court   in 




Abhinandan Jha & Ors. v. Dinesh Mishra
 [AIR 1968 SC 117] 



to   the   provisions   of   
Section   173
   and   
Section   190
   of   the 



Criminal Procedure Code, 1898, which were the same as in 



the   
Criminal   Procedure   Code
,   1973.
 
In  
Abhinandan   Jha
 



(supra), para 15 at page 122 of the AIR this Court observed:




        "...   The   police,   after   such   investigation,   may 

        submit a charge-sheet, or, again submit a final 

        report, depending upon the further investigation 

        made   by   them.     If   ultimately,   the   Magistrate 

        forms  the  opinion  that the  facts,  set  out  in  the 

        final   report,   constitute   an   offence,   he   can   take 

        cognizance   of   the   offence,   under   
Section 

        190(1)(b)
,   notwithstanding   the   contrary   opinion 

        of the police, expressed in the final report."





11.    After referring to the law 
laid down in
 
Abhinandan Jha
 



(supra) this Court has further held in 
Mrs. Rupan Deol Bajaj  



&   Anr.   v.  Kanwar   Pal  Singh  Gill  &   Anr.
   [AIR   1996   SC   309] 



that where the police in its report of investigation or further 



investigation recommends discharge of the accused, but the 



complainant seeks to satisfy the Court that a case for taking 



cognizance   was   made   out,   the   Court   must   consider   the 



objections   of   the   complainant   and   if   it   overrules   such 



objections,   it   is   just   and   desirable   that   the   reasons   for 



                                    15





overruling the objections of the complainant be recorded by 



the Court  and this  was  necessary because the  Court  while 



exercising power under 
Section 190
, Cr.P.C. whether to take 



cognizance   or   not   to   take   cognizance   exercises   judicial 



discretion.




12.    In the facts of the present case, the police in its report 



submitted to the Judicial Magistrate, First Class, Ludhiana, 



on   02.02.2006   had   filed   two   challans,   one   against   the 



appellant,   his   father   Mohan   Singh   and   Bhupinder   Singh 



stating   that   they   had   committed   offences   under   
Sections 



452
, 
323
, 
326
, 506 read with 
Section 34
 of the IPC and the 



other challan against the respondent Nos.1 and 2 and some 



others   stating   that   they   had   committed   offences   under 




Sections   342
,   
323
,   
324
,   
148
   of   the   IPC.     Pursuant   to 



permission   granted   by   the   learned   Magistrate   on 



27.07.2006   for   further   investigation,   a   further   report   has 



been   made   by   the   Superintendent   of   Police,   City-II, 



Ludhiana, stating that respondent  no.1 for  his  self-defence 



had caused injuries to the appellant and others and hence 



the cross-case against the respondent no.1 is required to be 



cancelled.   This   further   report   has   to   be   forwarded   to   the 



                                       16





learned   Magistrate   and   as   has   been   held   by   this   Court   in 




Abhinandan  Jha
  (supra) and  
Mrs. Rupan Deol Bajaj
  (supra) 



it   was   for   the   learned   Magistrate   to   apply   judicial   mind   to 



the facts stated in the reports submitted under sub-sections 



(2) and (8) respectively of 
Section 173
, Cr.P.C., and to form 



an   opinion   whether   to   take   cognizance   or   not   to   take 



cognizance   against   the   respondent   no.1   after   considering 



the   objections,   if   any,   of   the   complainant,   namely,   the 



appellant.




13.       
Section 482
 of the Cr.P.C. saves the inherent powers 



of the High Court to make such orders as may be necessary 



to   give   effect   to   any   order   under   the   Code   or   to   prevent 



abuse of the process of any court or otherwise to secure the 



ends   of   justice.     It   has   been   held   by   this   Court   in  
R.   P.  



Kapur  v.  State   of   Punjab
  [AIR   1960   SC   866]   that   
Section 



561-A
   of   the   Criminal   Procedure   Code,   1898   (which 



corresponds to 
Section 482
 of the Criminal Procedure Code, 



1973)  saves   the  inherent  power  of  the  High  Court  to  make 



such orders as may be necessary to give effect to any order 



under   the   Code   or   to   prevent   abuse   of   the   process   of   any 



court   or   otherwise   to   secure   the   ends   of   justice   and   such 



                                     17





inherent   power   cannot   be   exercised   in   regard   to   matters 



specifically covered by the other provisions of the Code and 



therefore   where   the   Magistrate   has   not   applied   his   mind 



under 
Section 190
 of the Cr.P.C. to the merits of the reports 



and   passed   order,   the   High   Court   ought   not   to   consider   a 



request for  quashing   the  proceedings.
 
In  the  case  of  
R. P.  



Kapur
  (supra)   on   10.12.1958,   M.L.   Sethi   lodged   a   First 



Information   Report  against   R.P.   Kapur   and   alleged   that  he 



and   his   mother-in-law   had   committed   offences   under 




Sections 420-109
, 
114
 and 
120B
 of the Indian Penal Code.




R.P.   Kapur   moved   the   Punjab   High   Court   under   
Section 



561-A
   of   the   Code   of   Criminal   Procedure   for   quashing   the 



proceedings initiated by the First Information Report.  When 



the   petition   of   R.P.   Kapur   was   pending   in   the   High   Court, 



the police report was submitted under Section 173, Cr.P.C. 



and the High Court held that no case had been made out for 



quashing   the   proceedings   under   
Section   561-A
   of   the 



Criminal Procedure Code, 1898 and dismissed the petition. 



R.   P.   Kapur   carried   an   appeal   by   way   of   Special   Leave   to 



this Court and this Court dismissed the appeal for inter alia 



the following reasons: 



                                              18


            "   ...     In   the   present   case   the   magistrate   before 

            whom the police report has been filed under
 S. 

            173
 of the Code has yet not applied his mind to 

            the   merits   of   the   said   report   and   it   may   be 

            assumed   in   favour   of   the   appellant   that   his 

            request   for   the   quashing   of   the   proceedings   is 

            not at the present stage covered by any specific 

            provision of the Code.  It is well established that 

            the   inherent   jurisdiction   of   the   High   Court   can 

            be   exercised   to   quash   proceedings   in   a   proper 

            case   either  to   prevent  the   abuse  of  the   process 

            of  any court  or otherwise to secure  the ends  of 

            justice.           Ordinarily,          criminal         proceedings 

            instituted   against   an   accused   person   must   be 

            tried under the provisions of the Code, and the 

            High Court would be reluctant to interfere with 

            the said proceedings at an interlocutory stage..." 



             


As   we   have   found   in   the   present   case   that   learned 



Magistrate   had   not   applied   his   mind   to   the   merits   of   the 



reports   filed   under   
Section   173
,   Cr.P.C.,   we   are   of   the 



considered   opinion   that   the   exercise   of   power   by   the   High 



Court   under   
Section   482
,   Cr.P.C.,   was   at   an   interlocutory 



stage and was not warranted in the facts of this case.



14.                  In   the   result,   the   appeal   is   allowed   and   the 



impugned   order   dated   25.03.2008   is   set   aside.   The   police 



will   forward   the   further   report   of   the   Superintendent   of 



Police,   City-II,   Ludhiana,   to   the   Magistrate   concerned   and 



the   learned   Magistrate   will   apply   his   mind   to   the   police 



report   already   forwarded   to   him   and   the   further   report   of 



                                         19





further   investigation   forwarded   to   him   and   take   a   final 



decision   in   accordance   with   law   after   considering   the 



objections, if any, of the appellant against the further report 



of further investigation.
