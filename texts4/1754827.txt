                      CRIMINAL APPEAL NO(s). 1098 OF 2006



   STATE OF KERALA & ANR.                           Appellant (s)



                 VERSUS



  C.P. RAO                                          Respondent(s)





                                   J U D G M E N T



GANGULY, J.





        Heard learned counsel for the parties.





        This   is   an   appeal   against   the   judgment   and   order   of 

acquittal   dated   19th  January,   2005   rendered   by   the   High   Court. 

The respondent facing a trial, was convicted under Sections 7 and 

13(2) read with 
Section 13(1)(d)
 of Prevention of Corruption Act, 

1988 by the Special Judge, Thiruvananthapuram, in Criminal Case 

No.   9   of   1996   and   the   respondent   was   sentenced   to   undergo 

rigorous imprisonment for 20 months and pay a fine of Rs. 2500/- 

under the former charge and rigorous imprisonment for two years 

and   a   fine   of   Rs.   2500/-   under   the   second   charge.     Default 

stipulations were also there.





        The   facts   relating   to   that   case   have   been   summed   up   in 

the judgment of the High Court and we are not repeating the same 

here once again.





                                        -2-


         In   passing   the   order   of   acquittal,   the   High   Court 

examined and analysed in detail the evidence of the case.   The 

High Court found that the complainant CW 1 was not examined and 

the only explanation given was that he was not available in the 

country   but   no   details   were   given   as   to   where   the   complainant 

was.   The defence of the respondent in this case has also been 

noted by the High Court in some detail.





         The   prosecution   case   is   that   the   demand   of   illegal 

gratification of Rs. 5000/- was made by the respondent from CW 1 

on   19.10.1994   for   the   purpose   of   giving   pass   marks   to   all   the 

students   who   appeared   in   the   practical   examination   of 

pharmaceutical-II in D-Pharma final examination in the year 1994. 

It is an admitted case that the respondent alone cannot give such 

marks.  In view of the  examination system prevailing such marks 

have to be approved by others.  The respondent alone, therefore, 

is   admittedly   not   in   a   position   to   allot   higher   marks.     Apart 

from that, it is the case of the respondent that when CW 1 met 

him  in a  hotel room,  the respondent  shouted that  some currency 

notes had been thrust into his pocket by CW 1.   Such shouts of 

the respondent were heard by PW 1 and PW 2.  The evidence of PW 1 

and PW 2 were recorded by the Trial Court. The evidence of PW 1 

and  PW 2  could not  be, in  any way,  shaken by  manner of  cross-

examination.     PW   3   has   also   given   evidence   of   the   previous 

animosity between the college authorities and the respondent who 

had an occasion to file reports with the college authorities on 

the basis of some inspection.



         In   the   background   of   these   facts,   especially   the   non-

examination of CW 1, was found very crucial by the High Court. 


The   High   Court   has   referred   to   the   decision   of   this   Court   in 

Panalal   Damodar   Rathi  Vs.  State   of   Maharashtra  1979(4)   SCC   526 

wherein  a Three-Judge  Bench of  this Court  held that  when there 

was   no   corroboration   of   testimony   of   the   complainant   regarding 

the demand of bribe by the accused, it has to be accepted that 

the   version   of   the   complainant   is   not   corroborated   and, 

therefore, the evidence of the complainant cannot be relied on.


                                    -3-


         In the aforesaid circumstances, the Three-Judge Bench in 

Pannalal   Damodar   Rathi   case(supra)   held   that   there   is   grave 

suspicion about the appellant's complicity and the case has not 

been proved beyond reasonable doubt. (see para 11)



         This   Court   finds   that   the   appreciation   of   the   ratio   in 

Panalal Damodar Rathi case(supra) by the High Court was correctly 

made in the facts and circumstances of the case.




         Apart   from   that,   Mr.   P.P.   Rao,   learned   counsel   for   the 

respondent   has   drawn   attention   of   this   Court   to   some   other 

pronouncements of this Court on the relevant question.




 
In 
C.M. Girish Babu Vs. CBI, Cochin, High
 Court of Kerala 

reported   in   2009(3)SCC   779,   this   Court   while   dealing   with   the 

case under the 
Prevention of Corruption Act
 1988, by referring to 

its previous decision in the case of  
Suraj Mal  Vs.  State (Delhi  

Admn
.)  reported   in   1979(4)   SCC   725   held   that   mere   recovery   of 

tainted money, divorced from the circumstances under which it is 

paid,   is   not   sufficient   to   convict   the   accused   when   the 

substantive   evidence   in   the   case   is   not   reliable.     The   mere 

recovery   by   itself   cannot   prove   the   charge   of   the   prosecution 

against   the   accused.     In   the   absence   of   any   evidence   to   prove 

payment of bribe or to show that the accused voluntarily accepted 

the money knowing it to be bribe conviction cannot be sustained.


(See para 18) 


         In   a   subsequent   decision   of   this   Court   also   under   the 


Prevention of Corruption Act
, in the case of 
A. Subair Vs. State 

of   Kerala
  2009(6)   SCC   587,   this   Court   made   certain   pertinent 

observations   about   the   necessity   of   the   presence   of   the 

complainant   in   a   bribery   case.     The   relevant   observations   have 

been made in paragraph 18 and 19 which are quoted below:-


                                     -4-


             18.      The High Court held that since the Special 

             Judge made attempts to secure the presence of the 

             complainant   and   those   attempts   failed   because   he 

             was   not   available   in   India,   there   was 

             justification   for   non-examination   of   the 

             complainant.





             19.      We   find   it   difficult   to   countenance   the 

             approach   of   the   High   Court.     In   the   absence   of 

             semblance   of   explanation   by   the   investigating 

             officer   for   the   non-examination   of   the 

             complainant, it was not open to the courts below 

             to   find   out   their   own   reason   for   not   tendering 

             the complainant in evidence.   It has, therefore, 

             to   be   held   that   the   best   evidence   to   prove   the 

             demand was not made available before the court.




         Those   observations   quoted   above   are   clearly   applicable 

in this case.   
In the context of those observations, this Court 

in   paragraph   28   of  
A.   Subair
  (supra)   made   it   clear   that   the 

prosecution has to prove the charge beyond reasonable doubt like 

any other criminal offence and the accused should be considered 

innocent   till   it   is   proved   to   the   contrary   by   proper   proof   of 


demand   and   acceptance   of   illegal   gratification,   which   is   the 

vital ingredient to secure the conviction in a bribery case.


         In   view   of   the   aforesaid   settled   principles   of   law,   we 

find it difficult to take a view different from the one taken by 

the High Court.





 
In coming to its conclusion, we are reminded of the well 

settled   principle   that   when   the   court   has   to   exercise   its 

discretion   in   an   appeal   arising   against   an   order   of   acquittal, 

the   Court   must   remember   that   the   innocence   of   the   accused   is 

further re-established by the judgment of acquittal rendered by 

the High Court.  Against such decision of the High Court, the






                           -5-




  scope of interference by this Court in order of acquittal has 

been   very   succinctly   
laid   down   by
   a   Three-Judge   bench   of   this 

Court   in   the   case   of  
Sanwat   Singh   &   others  Vs.  State   of 

Rajasthan
 1961(3) SCR 120.  At page 129, Justice Subba Rao(as His 

Lordship then was) culled out the principles as follows:-


               "The foregoing  discussion yields  the following 

      results:   (1)   an   appellate   court   has   full   power   to 

      review the evidence upon which the order of acquittal 

      is   founded;   (2)   the   principles   
laid   down   in
   Sheo 

      Swarup's  case 1934  L.R. 61  I.A. 398  afford a  correct 

      guide for the appellate court's approach to a case in 

      disposing   of   such   an   appeal;   and   (3)   the   different 

      phraseology used in the judgments of this Court, such 

      as   (i)   "substantial   and   compelling   reasons",   (ii) 

      "good   and   sufficiently   cogent   reasons",   and   (iii) 

      "strong   reasons"   are   not   intended   to   curtail   the 


      undoubted   power   of   an   appellate   court   in   an   appeal 

      against acquittal to review the entire evidence and to 

      come to its own conclusion; but in doing so it should 

      not   only   consider   every   matter   on   record   having   a 

      bearing on the questions of fact and the reasons given 

      by   the   court   below   in   support   of   its   order   of 

      acquittal   in   its   arriving   at   a   conclusion   on   those 

      facts,   but   should   also   express   those   reasons   in   its 

      judgment, which lead it to hold that the acquittal was 

      not justified." 





                                -6-


        We   are   in   respectful   agreement   with   the   aforesaid 

salutary principles settled by this Court and we are constrained 

to   hold   that   this   appeal   has   no   merit   and   is   accordingly 

dismissed.
