                        vs.

       STATE OF MADHYA PRADESH                     ..  RESPONDENT(S)


                                                                                  O 
                                                                        R D E R





             This appeal arises out of the following facts:


             At   about   10.00   a.m.   on   the   30th  August   1984   the 

     prosecutrix (PW.1) had gone to relieve herself and as she 

     was returning home, she was waylaid by the appellants who 

     carried her to a nearby field and thereafter  raped her and 

     while leaving threatened her with dire consequences if she 

     revealed what had happened to anyone. She however returned 


home   and   told   her   parents   about   the   rape.   Accompanied   by 

her parents she then went to the police outpost at Pathriya 

to lodge a report but no police official was found present 

therein.    A  report   was  then   lodged  the   next  day   at  about 

12.15 p.m. by PW.1  at Sironj Police Station about 22 k.m. 


away from the place of incident though the police station 

of village Kasbatal was Unarasital only 7 k.m. away..   The 

prosecutrix   was   accordingly   sent   for   her   medical 





examination to the hospital at     Vasoda.   Information was 

also sent to police Station Unarasital along with the 






                                   -2-


medical   examination   report   Ex.P.A.   and   the   subsequent 


investigation   was   conducted   by   the     police   of   police 

station   Unarasital   who   seized   the   petticoat   of   the 

prosecutrix and  sent it for examination.


         On   the  completion   of  the   investigation  the   accused 

were   charged   under   
Sec.376   (2)(g)
   of   the     IPC   for   having 

committed   gang   rape   on   PW.1.   The   Trial   Court,   vide   its 

judgment   dated   the   6th  January,   1992   observed   that   in   the 

light   of   the   fact   that   the   FIR   had   been   lodged   after   a 





delay   of   about   60   hours   and   that   the   statement   of   the 

prosecutrix   was   full   of   contradictions   and   as   the 

statements   of   her   father   and   mother   (PW2   and   PW.3)   were 

based on the information given by her to them, no reliance 

could be placed on their evidence as well. The Court also 

found   that   in   the   light   of   the   fact   that   the   prosecutrix 

had declined to be medically examined at Sironj,  where the 

First Information Report had been lodged, and had insisted 


that   she   be   examined   at   Vasoda   which   was   55   k.ms.   away, 

cast a doubt on the prosecution story.    The court further 

observed   that   as   per   the   medical   evidence   no   injury   had 

been found on her person though she had been raped by two 

persons and as such there was no evidence to suggest that 

rape had been committed.  On a cumulative assessment of the 

prosecution evidence the Trial Court acquitted the accused. 


         An appeal was thereafter filed  by the State before 





the High Court.  The High Court has given a finding that 






                                   -3-


the decision of the Trial Court was perverse and called for 

interference. The High Court has relied on the evidence of 

PW.1 and her parents   as also on some part of the evidence 


of   Dr.   Mamta   Sthapak-PW.7   who   had   medically   examined   the 

prosecutrix   after   about     24   hours.   The   High   Court   has 

accordingly   allowed   the   appeal   and   sentenced   the   accused 

to 10 years R.I. with a fine of Rs.25,000/- under 
Section 

376(2)(g)
 of the IPC, and in default of payment of fine, RI 

for two years.



        The matter is before us in the above background.

        At   the   very   outset   we   must   remark   that   the   High 





Court's   interference   in   an   appeal   against   acquittal   is 

somewhat circumscribed and if the view taken by the Trial 

Court was possible on the evidence, the High Court should 

stay   its   hands   and   not   interfere   in   the   matter   in   the 

belief  that   if  it   had  been   in  Trial   Court,  it   might  have 

taken a different view.   In other words, if two views are 

possible and the Trial Court has taken one, the High Court 

should not interfere in the judgment of the Trial Court.



         We have examined the evidence   in the light of the 

above   principle.   We   first   see   that   the   First   Information 

Report   had   been   lodged   after   about   60   hours   of   the 

incident.  The prosecution case is that PW.1 accompanied by 

her   parents   had   gone   to   police   post   Patharia   attached   to 

Police Station Unarasital immediately after the incident 






                                   -4-


but   had   found   no   police   official   present   therein   and   had 

then gone     to police station Sironj   and lodged a report 

at 12 noon the next day. We find that the explanation for 

this delay is somewhat difficult to believe.  A police post 


may   have   a   few   police   officials   posted   in   it,   but   police 

station Unarasital was a full fledged police station which 

would invariably be manned.  Moreover,  even if no one  was 

found   in   the   police   post   on   the   first   day,   at   that 

particular   point   of   time   the   effort   of   the   prosecutrix 

ought   to   have   been   to   lodge   a   report   later     at   Police 

Station Unarasital, but she chose to go to  police Station 

Sironj and recorded her statement and the investigation was 





thereafter  referred   to  police   station  Unarasital.     We   are 

also indeed surprised that the High Court has made light of 

the fact that the prosecutrix had declined to undergo her 

medical   examination   at   Sironj   and   had   insisted   for   her 

medical   examination   at   Vasoda,     55   k.m.   away.     The 

prosecution has not been able to furnish any explanation as 

to   why   the   prosecutrix   had   insisted   on   being   examined   at 

Vasoda.





         We have also examined the medical report. Dr. Mamta 

Sthapak-PW.7  found   no  injury   on  her   genetalia  and   deposed 

that there was no evidence to show that she had been raped 

as the tear in her   hymen was an old one. The prosecutrix 

also stated that at the time of her medical examination at 

Vasoda   her   vagina   had   been   stitched.   The   doctor   found   no 

stitch on her person.





                                   -5-


         We are therefore of the opinion that on a cumulative 

assessment of the evidence, as given above, the finding of 

the   Trial   Court   could   have   been   given   under   the 

circumstances   and   the   High   Court's   interference   was, 

therefore,   not   called   for.   The   appeal   is   accordingly 


allowed, the conviction of the appellants is set aside and 

they are acquitted.



       The appellants are on bail; their bail bonds shall 

stand discharged.
