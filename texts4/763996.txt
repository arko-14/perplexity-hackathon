   1.       All the three appeals have been preferred against the common 


   judgment   and   order   dated   14.7.2003   passed   by   the   High   Court   of 


Judicature at Madras in Criminal Appeal Nos. 981 and 986 of 2002, 


by which the High Court had disposed of the said appeals preferred 


by   the   appellants   against   the   judgment   and   order   of   the   trial   court 


dated   24.6.2002,   in   Sessions   Case   No.   30   of   2000,   by   which 


appellant Murugan @ Settu (A.1) had been convicted under  
Sections 


366
 and 
376
  of the Indian Penal Code, 1860 (hereinafter referred to 


as `
IPC
') and awarded the sentence of   rigorous imprisonment for 3 


and     7   years   on   those   counts   respectively.   Other   appellants   stood 


convicted under 
Sections 366
  r/w  109 
IPC
 and were sentenced for 3 


years rigorous imprisonment. 



2.      FACTS :



(A)     The prosecution case reveals that on 11.2.1998 at 9.00 A.M., 


Murugan   @   Settu   (A.1)   with   an   intention   to   marry   the   minor   girl 


Shankari (PW.4), aged  14 years studying in 8th standard, kidnapped 


her   from   S.S.K.V.   School,   Kancheepuram,   by   stating   that   her 


mother, Parimala (PW.15) was seriously ill and had been admitted to 


hospital.  Shankari (PW.4) took permission to leave the school from 


her teacher, Rajeshwari (PW.5) and also informed about the said fact 


to her classmate P. Megala  (PW.6).





                                                                                     2



(B)     Shankari (PW.4) was taken by A.1 in an auto bearing No. TN 


21 B 6582 to Kamatchi Amman  Temple,   where Shiva (A.2)   also 


came and both of them took Shankari (PW.4) to Orikai road stating 


that they were going to the hospital. 





(C)     On being questioned by Shankari (PW.4), she was threatened 


by A.1 and A.2 that if she made noise they would spoil her life. She 


was taken to the house of Smt. Logammal (PW.7), the grand-mother 


of   A.2     at   Kaliampoondi,   at   about   1.00   P.M.   They   stayed   there   at 


night.   On   12.2.1998,   M.P.   Ekambaram   (PW.1),   father   of   Shankari 


(PW.4) lodged an FIR in Crime No. 209 of 1998 that his daughter 


had gone to attend the school on 11.2.1998 and did not return. Thus, 


she was missing. 



(D)      On the same day, i.e. 12.2.1998, Ramalingam @ Ramu (A.3) 


came   from   Kancheepuram.     All   the   accused   compelled   Shankari 


(PW.4) to get married with A.1 and, accordingly, A.1 tied `Thali' in 


Shankari's   neck.     A.1   and   A.3  took   Shankari   (PW.4)   to   Bangalore 


leaving A.2 at Vellore.   They went to New Lingapuram, Bangalore, 


to   the   house   of   Rajeshwari   (PW.9),   sister   of   A.3   and   stayed   there 


upto   24.2.1998.     During   this   period,   A.1   raped   the   prosecutrix 






                                                                                   3



Shankari  (PW.4)   many  times.  They   reached  Chennai   and  stayed   in 


the house of Vijayalakshmi (PW.12).



(E)        As there had been an FIR in respect to the fact that Shankari 


(PW.4) had been missing, Pugazhendhi (PW.19), Inspector of Police, 


Kanchi Taluk Police Station after receiving the information that A.1 


and   prosecutrix   Shankari   (PW.4)   would   appear   before   the   court   at 


Kancheepuram reached there, and made a written application before 


the Judicial Magistrate, Kancheepuram for sending A.1 and Shankari 


(PW.4) for medical examination. The application was accepted.  



(F)      Dr. Parasakthi (PW.18) examined Shankari (PW.4) and issued 


a medical certificate, Ex.P-10 to the effect that she had been sexually 


assaulted.   Dr. K. Gururaj (PW.20) examined A.1 on 26.3.1998 and 


issued   certificate   Exs.P-14   and   P-15   to   the   effect   that   he   was   not 


impotent.  He also examined Shankari (PW.4) and issued certificates 


including Ex.P-16 giving his opinion that she was about 18 years of 


age. 



(G)      After   completing   the   investigation,   charge   sheet   was 


submitted.   Subsequently, the trial court framed the charges against 


A.1 under 
Sections 366
 and 
376
 IPC and so far as A.2 and A.3 were 






                                                                                    4



concerned, they were charged under 
Sections 366
 r/w 109 
IPC
 and 



Sections   376
   r/w   109   
IPC
.   As   all   the   three   appellants   denied   the 


charges and claimed trial, they were proceeded with trial. 



(H)    In support of its case, the prosecution examined 21 witnesses 


and 12 documents were exhibited and marked. Five properties were 


also marked. In defence, the appellants examined a photographer as 


DW.1.   Three   documents   i.e.   D1   to   D3   were   also   exhibited   and 


marked. After concluding the trial,  the Sessions  Court convicted all 


the appellants and imposed punishment as aforesaid. 



(I)    Being   aggrieved,   all   the   three   appellants   preferred   Criminal 


Appeals before the High Court which have been disposed of by the 


common   judgment   and   order   impugned   herein   with   certain 


modifications  in the conviction and sentence so far as A.2 and A.3 


are concerned.   It set aside their conviction under 
Sections 366
 r/w 


109   
IPC
   and   convicted   them   under   
Sections   363
   r/w   109   
IPC
   and 


imposed punishment of two years. Hence, these appeals.  



3.     Shri   G. Sivabalamurugan,    learned   counsel  appearing  for  the 


appellants, has   challenged the concurrent findings recorded by the 


courts   below   mainly   on   the   grounds   that   the   courts   failed   to 






                                                                                  5



appreciate that Shankari (PW.4) had gone voluntarily with A.1 as she 


was   in   love   with   him   and   wanted   to   marry   him   and   not   under 


compulsion of any one else.  A.2 and A.3 had played no role in their 


affair   or   marriage.     All   independent   witnesses   i.e.   Smt.   Logammal 


(PW.7);   Rajeshwari   (PW.9)   and   Vijayalakshmi   (PW.12)   turned 


hostile.   Shankari   (PW.4)   was   major   as   opined   by     Dr.   K.   Gururaj 


(PW.20)   who issued certificate to the effect that   she was about 18 


years   of   age.   The   courts     erred   in   placing   reliance   upon   the   birth 


certificate of Shankari (PW.4) either given by the Municipality or by 


the School on the basis of the School Register. In the birth certificate 


issued   by   the   Municipality,   the   name   of   the   prosecutrix   was   not 


mentioned.   Neither   M.P.   Ekambaram   (PW.1),   father   nor   Parimala 


(PW.15), mother  of the prosecutrix, was able to state the correct age 


and they were not sure about the date of birth and age of Shankari 


(PW.4). In such a fact-situation,  conviction of the appellants is liable 


to be set aside. 



4.       On   the   other   hand,   Shri   S.   Thananjayan,   learned   counsel 


appearing   for   the   State   has   vehemently   opposed   the   appeals 


contending that there are concurrent findings of fact  recorded by the 


courts below, particularly on the most material issue i.e.   regarding 






                                                                                     6



the age of the prosecutrix    Shankari  (PW.4),   to the effect that she 


was   minor.     The   school   register   and   birth   certificate   issued   by   the 


Municipality   are   admissible   pieces   of   evidence   under   the   
Indian 


Evidence Act, 1872
   and have rightly been relied upon.   In case the 


finding   on   the   issue   of   age   of   the   prosecutrix   is   not   disturbed,   the 


question of entertaining any other issue does not arise. The appeals 


are devoid of any merit and are liable to be dismissed. 



5.            We   have  considered   the   rival   submissions   made   by   learned 


counsel for the parties and perused the record. 



         We are in full agreement with the learned counsel appearing 


 for the State that in case the finding recorded by the courts below on 


 minority   of  the   prosecutrix   remains   undisturbed,   no   other   issue   is 


 required to be examined. 



6.      Age as per the documents :



I.      Relevant part of the FIR lodged by M.P. Ekambaram (PW.1) 


father of the prosecutrix  reads as under: 





                  "My   daughter's   name   is   Shankari,   aged   about  

         14   years   and   studying   in   8th  Std.   at   S.S.K.V.   School.  



         She   went   on   11.2.1998   at   9   A.M.   and   did   not   return  

         home. I came to know that she is missing."



                                                                                        7


II.     Relevant   part   of   the   certificate   of   birth     issued   by   the 


Department of Public Health, under 
Section 17
 of the Registration of 


Birth   and   Deaths   Act,   1969,   issued   by   the   Commissioner, 


Kancheepuram Municipality reads as under: 



               Name                           -..............

               Date of Birth                  - 30.3.1984

               Date of Registration           -5.4.1984

               Sex                            - Female


               Registration No.               - 140


               Name of father                 - M.P. Ekambaram 

               Name of Mother                 - Parimala




III.    The   date   of   birth   certificate   issued   by   the   Head   Master, 



S.S.K.V. Higher Secondary School, Kancheepuram reads as under: 



                       "Certified   that   E.   Shankari   D/o   M.P.  

        Ekambaram was a student of this school in Eighth Std.  

        during 1997-98 and her date of birth as per our school  

        record   (Admn.No.13714   (n.c.)   is   30.3.1984   (Thirtieth  

        March Nineteen Eighty Four)."  





IV.     Dr.     K.   Gururaj   (PW.20)   examined   prosecutrix   Shankari 


(PW.4)   and   on   the   basis   of   Radiological   Test   Report   (Ex.P.16) 


opined that she was aged about 18 years. 



7.       Evidence of the witnesses in respect of age :



I.      M.P. Ekambaram (PW.1) in his examination-in-chief does not 


say anything about the age of the prosecutrix. Thus, the defence did 


not  cross-examine  him  on  this   issue.     However,   no  suggestion   had 





                                                                               8



been put to him by the defence that she was major and had developed 


a liking/love affair with A.1 and had voluntarily gone with him.  




II.       Parimala (PW.15), mother of the prosecutrix had deposed that 


the   date   of   birth   of   the   prosecutrix   was   30.3.1984.   At   the   relevant 


time, prosecutirix was studying in 8th  standard and was 14 years of 


age. Suggestion   put to her that she was deposing about the age of 


her younger daughter  and not of Shankari (PW.4)  was denied.  She 


also denied that she was deposing falsely. 






III.     Mrs. Gayathri (PW.11), Head Mistress, SSKV School, proved 


the certificate and stated that in the school register the date of birth of 


Shankari (PW.4) had been recorded as 30.3.1984.  





8.      The defence has placed reliance on Ex. D-1, a letter written by 


the prosecutrix to the police officer which reads:



                 "I   am   in   love   with   Murugan   for   the   past   1   =  

         years. My school age is 15 years. My hospital age is  

         17 years. My father and mother would go by caste.   I  

         talked   with   him   without   knowledge   of   my   father   and  

         mother.   When   my   parents   came   to   know   about   our  

         affair they tortured me for 4 months. My lover told me  

         that   he   was   going   to   die   by   consuming   `poison'.   I  

         insisted that if   I live, I can live with him otherwise   I  

         will die. He did not take me out. I only took him out. I  

         am   requesting   the   police   and   my   relatives   to   put   us  

         together,   otherwise   if   they   try   to   separate   us,   my  

         parents and police would be responsible.





                                                                                      9


                                                             Sd/-   Shankari"





9.        It   is   evident   from   the   aforesaid   documents   that   prosecutrix 


          Shankari   (PW.4)   had   developed   a   love   affair   with   A.1,   but 


          there   is   nothing   on   record   on   the   basis   of   which   she   had 


          written that her hospital age was 17 years.     No reliance can 


          be placed on such a letter in view of the certificates issued by 


          the Municipality  and the School. It is a matter of   common 


          knowledge   that   the   birth   certificate   issued   by   the 


          Municipality   generally   does   not   contain   the   name   of   the 


          child,   for   the   reason,   that   it   is   recorded   on   the   basis   of   the 


          information   furnished   either   by   the   hospital   or   parents   just 


          after  the birth  of the  child and  by  that  time  the  child  is not 


          named.  



10. 
In 
Mohd. Ikram Hussain v. State of U.P. & Ors.
,  AIR 1964 SC 



      1625, this Court had an occasion to examine a similar issue and 


      held as under:




          "In   the   present   case   Kaniz   Fatima   was   stated   to   be  

          under   the   age   of   18.   There   were   two   certified   copies  

          from  school   registers  which   showed  that  on  June   20,  

          1960 she was under 17 years of age. There  was also  

          the affidavit of the father stating the date of her birth  

          and the  statement  of Kaniz   Fatima  to the  police with  

          regard   to   her   own   age.   These   amounted   to   evidence  





                                                                                            10



        under   the   
Indian   Evidence   Act
   and   the   entries   in   the  

        school   registers   were   made  ante   litem   motam.   As  

        against   this   the   learned   Judges   apparently   held   that  

        Kaniz   Fatima   was   over   18   years   of   age.   They   relied  

        upon what was said to have been mentioned in a report  

        of   the   Doctor   who   examined   Kaniz   Fatima,.....The  

        High   Court   thus   reached   the   conclusion   about   the  

        majority without any evidence before it in support of it  

        and in the face of direct evidence against it."





11.    Documents made  ante litem motam can be relied upon safely, 


when such documents are admissible under 
Section 35
 of the Indian 


Evidence   Act,   1872.     (Vide:  
Umesh   Chandra   v.   State   of 


Rajasthan
,  AIR 1982 SC 1057; and  
State of Bihar & Ors. v. Sri 


Radha Krishna Singh & Ors.
, AIR 1983 SC 684).




12.    This Court in 
Madan Mohan Singh & Ors. v. Rajni Kant & 


Anr.
, AIR 2010 SC 2933, considered a large number of judgments 


including :  
Brij Mohan Singh v.  Priya Brat Narain Sinha & Ors
.




AIR 1965 SC 282; 
Birad Mal Singhvi v. Anand Purohit
 AIR 1988 


SC 1796;    
Updesh Kumar  & Ors.  v.  Prithvi Singh  & Ors.
, AIR 


2001  SC 703;   
State of Punjab v. Mohinder Singh
, AIR 2005 SC 


1868;  
Vishnu @ Undrya v. State of Maharashtra
,  AIR  2006 SC 


508;    
Satpal  Singh  v.  State   of   Haryana
  (2010)   8   SCC   714,     and 


came   to   the   conclusion   that   while   considering   such   an   issue   and 


documents   admissible   under   
Section   35
   of   the   Evidence   Act,   the 





                                                                                    11



court has a right to examine the probative value of the contents of the 


document.   Authenticity   of   entries   may   also   depend   on   whose 


information   such   entry   stood   recorded   and   what   was   his   source   of 


information, meaning thereby, that such document may also require 


corroboration in some cases.




13.     In   the   instant   case,   in   the   birth   certificate   issued   by   the 


Municipality,   the   birth   was   shown   to   be   as   on   30.3.1984; 



registration was made on 5.4.1984; registration number has also been 


shown;   and   names   of   the   parents   and   their   address   have   correctly 


been mentioned. Thus, there is no reason to doubt the veracity of  the 


said certificate. More so, the school certificate has been issued by the 


Head   Master   on   the   basis   of   the   entry   made   in   the   school   register 


which corroborates the contents of the certificate of birth issued by 


the Municipality. Both these entries in the school register as well, as 


in   the   Municipality   came   much   before   the   criminal   prosecution 


started  and those  entries  stand  fully  supported  and corroborated  by 


the   evidence   of   Parimala   (PW.15),   the   mother   of   the   prosecutrix. 



She had been cross examined at length but nothing could be elicited 


to doubt her testimony. The defence put a suggestion to her that she 


was   talking   about   the   age   of   her   younger   daughter   and   not   of 






                                                                                     12



Shankari (PW.4), which she flatly denied.   Her deposition remained 


un-shaken and is fully reliable. 



14.    In  view  of  the above,  we  do not  see  any  reason   to hold that 


prosecutrix,  Shankari (PW.4)  was major on the date of incident and 


in view thereof, no other issue is required to be considered. We also 


see no reason to interfere with the quantum of punishment in either 


of these appeals.  Thus, appeals fail and are accordingly dismissed. 



15.    The   appellants   are   on   bail.   Their   bail   bonds   are   cancelled. 



Appellants   must   surrender   within   30   days   from   today   to   serve   the 


remaining   part   of   the   sentences,   failing   which   the   Chief   Judicial 


Magistrate,   Kancheepuram,   Tamil   Nadu,   shall   apprehend   the 


appellants and send them to jail. Copy of the judgment and order be 


sent to the court concerned for information and compliance.
