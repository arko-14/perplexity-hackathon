"Banarsi Dass vs State Of Haryana on 5 April, 2010","630","Banarsi Dass Appellant Vs. State of Haryana Respondent JUDGMENT Swatanter Kumar, J. 1. The present appeal under Article 136 of the Constitution of India is directed against the final judgment and order of conviction dated 20.11.2002 passed by the learned Single Judge of the High Court of Punjab & Haryana at Chandigarh. Learned counsel appearing for the appellant has raised challenge to the impugned judgment, inter alia, but primarily on the following grounds: (a) There is no evidence to prove demand and voluntary acceptance of the alleged bribe so as to attract the offence under Section 5(2) of the Prevention of Cor- ruption Act, 1947 (For short, `the Act'). Reliance has been placed by the judgment of this Court in the case of C.M. Girish Babu vs. CBI, Cochin, High Court of Kerala, [2009 (3) SCC 779]. (b) The High Court as well as the trial Court have passed an order of conviction despite the fact that there was serious contradiction between the statements of the prosecution witnesses. And in fact, there was no cogent and reliable evidence to support the charge against the appellant. Even the recovery has not been proved in accordance with law. These fac- tors clearly justify the benefit of doubt in favour of the appellant and thus entitling the accused of judgment of acquittal. (c) The punishment awarded to the appellant is unreason- ably excessive. The appellant has faced the agony of trial and thereafter other proceedings arising therefrom for the last 20 years. In these circum- stances, the appellant has even faced great hardship having lost his livelihood which adversely affected the future of his family members. While relying upon the judgment of this Court in the case of Aditya Nath Pandey v. State of U.P. [2000 (9) SCC 206], it is contended that the sentence undergone would suf- fice and meet the ends of justice. Of course, this argument has been advanced without prejudice to the above contentions. 2. On behalf of the State, it has been argued that the judgment of conviction and sentence is duly supported by the oral and documentary evidence produced by the prosecution. The prosecution has been able to bring home the charge against the accused. The ingredients of Section 5(2) of the Act as well as Section 161 of the Indian Penal Code (for short, `the IPC `) are duly satisfied. The appellant being a public servant has not to indulge in demanding bribe. Thus, no leniency is called for in favour of the accused. In order to examine the merit or otherwise the contentions raised, it is important for us to refer to the basic facts as emerged from the records, giving rise to the present appeal. 3. The appellant was newly posted as patwari in Village Piruwala. One Pritam Kaur had agricultural land at Village Piruwala. Her daughter, namely, Sat Pal Kaur was informed during 1986 that Khasra Girdawaris of Pritam Kaur's land had been recorded in the name of Jit Singh and others as tenants by the previous Patwari. Smt. Sat Pal Kaur took up the matter with those tenants who admitted that the Khasra Girdawaris has been wrongly recorded by the Ex-Patwari in their favour. She also obtained no-objection on the application moved by her mother which was submitted to the Tehsildar Chachhrauli. The application was moved for the purposes of incorporating the necessary changes at the time of the next Khasra Girdawaris in the coming season. Smt. Sat Pal Kaur contacted the village Patwari (appellant herein) in the Kharif season for recording Khasra Girdawaris in favour of her mother during the period of October, 1986. It is further the case of the prosecution that the appellant demanded illegal gratification of Rs. 900/- (rupees nine hundred) but that deal was struck at Rs. 400/- (rupees four hundred) for making the requisite changes, in the presence of Gurmej Singh, a taxi driver, whose taxi had been engaged by Sat Pal Kaur while visiting the appellant. Sat Pal Kaur contacted Shri Hari Singh, Deputy Superintendent of Police, Jagadhri at Bilaspur where Shri S.K. Joshi, Sub- Divisional Executive Magistrar, Jagadhri, was also present. She reported the matter. Her statement was recorded. She also produced four currency notes of the denomination of Rs. 100/- each and the same were signed both by Hari Singh, DSP and S.K. Joshi, Sub-divisional Executive Magistrate. They went to Patwari of Chachhrauli. They were told by the officers that on demand she should hand over the money and once money was accepted she should inform the Police Station and the trap was accordingly planned. Sat Pal Kaur accompanied by Gurmej Singh left for Patwar-khana which was about one km. from the Police Station, Chachhrauli. She took Rs. 400/- duly signed by the said officers to pay as gratification to the Patwari. The money was given to the appellant and accordingly Gurmej Singh reported the matter to Shri Hari Singh, DSP and Shri S.K. Joshi at the Police Station. They rushed to the spot in a jeep that was parked at some distance from Patwar-khana. On actual search of the appellant, four currency notes duly signed by the officers were recovered from the front left pocket of the shirt. Recovery memo for the same was prepared. The tenants had raised no objection and that application was also found on the table of the appellant in Patwar-khana which was taken into possession. After conclusion of the trap, the appellant was arrested and a case was registered with the Police Station Chachhrauli. After completion of the investigation, a challan regarding commission of offence under Section 161 of the IPC and under Section 5(2) of the Act was filed before the Court of competent jurisdiction. The Court framed charges on both these offences and the appellant was put to trial. 4. The prosecution in support of its case examined Tara Chand Pawar (PW-1), Smt. Sat Pal Kaur (PW-2), Rajiv Sharma (PW-3), Gurmej Singh (PW-4), Daya Singh (PW-5), Subhash Chander Patwari (PW-6), Shiv Dayal Reader (PW-7), Prem Bihari Lal (PW-8), Ram Chander, ASI(PW-9), Shri S.K. Joshi (PW-10) and Shri Hari Ram, DSP (PW-11) and closed its evidence. When the appellant was examined under Section 313 of Criminal Procedure Code, 1973 (for short `the Cr.P.C .'), he denied the allegations leveled against him and claimed to be innocent. 5. The special Judge, Ambala, by order dated 30.01.1988 convicted and sentenced the appellant under Section 161 of the IPC to undergo rigorous imprisonment for three years and under Section 5(2) of the Act to undergo rigorous imprisonment for four years and to pay a fine of Rs.1,000/-. Feeling aggrieved by this order, the appellant filed Criminal Appeal No. 83-SB of 1988 in the High Court of Punjab & Haryana at Chandigarh. The High Court by order dated 20.11.2002 dismissed the appeal holding that the appellant was rightly convicted. 6. To establish the charge against the appellant-accused, the prosecution in relation to the demand and receipt of the illegal gratification, had examined mainly four witnesses; Sat Pal Kaur (PW-2), Gurmej Singh (PW-4), S.K. Joshi (PW-10) and Hari Singh (PW-11). Out of these material witnesses, PW-2 and PW-4 both were declared hostile and were cross-examined by the public prosecutor. Leave to that effect was granted by the Court. PW-2 had stated in her examination-in-chief that she apprehended that appellant wanted illegal gratification and for that reason he was not recording the change in Khasra Girdawaris in favour of her mother. PW-2 further stated that she had learnt from co-villagers that Rs.300-400/- as reward was to be given for such a job. She had contacted the police thereafter. She was confronted with her statement EX.PB recorded under Section 161 of the IPC wherein she had stated that Banarsi Dass had demanded illegal gratification of Rs. 400/- from her in the presence of Gumrej Singh. She also stated that she had signed the memos but she did not read them as she was quite puzzled. In the cross-examination, she also stated that ""earlier to the day of the raid, Banarsi Dass has demanded Rs. 900/-. It is correct that accused Banarsi Dass had apologized to me and I have accepted his apology"". She further volunteered, ""it is my humble request to the Court that the Court should also accept the apology of the accused who has got small children to maintain"". Thereafter, she proceeded to state that she had paid a sum of Rs. 400/- to the accused for recording girdwari of the current crop in favour of the mother. In her cross-examination, it has also been stated that when she placed Rs. 400/- on his table, the accused had already recorded girdawari in favour of Jit Singh and others and the same had been verified by the Kanungo. She (PW-2) had an altercation with the accused as to why he had recorded Girdwari in favour of Jit Singh and others. Then she placed Rs. 400/- on the table wherefrom the same was picked up by the police. Gumrej Singh (PW-4), the other witness who was also declared hostile and who was subjected to cross-examination by the prosecution, stated that the appellant had not accepted or demanded any money from Sat Pal Kaur in his presence. He denied that he had made any statement to the police (Ex.PW-3/A). His statement under Section 161 of the IPC was completely denied by him. According to him, he had taken Sat Pal Kaur to Chachhrauli but he remained sitting in the car, 100 yards away from Patwar-khana and he did not know the accused as he hailed from Chachhrauli. 7. Witnesses PW-10 and PW-11 are the Senior Officers of the Administration and the Police. The complainant complained to them about the appellant demanding bribe from her for correcting the Khasra Girdawaris in the name of the mother of PW-2. A trap was planned. In furtherance to which PW-2 had gone to the Patwar-khana and gave Rs. 400/- (the signed notes of Rs.100/- each) upon which the Gurmej Singh was supposed to have informed the police, about the acceptance of money by the appellant. Thereafter, the police came to the spot and recovered the money from the front left pocket of the appellant's shirt. The search of the appellant was conducted by the police and money was recovered (Ex.P1 to Ex.P4) for which memo Ex.PD. was prepared. The tainted notes, shirt and even the money otherwise recovered from the pocket of the appellant were taken into custody vide these exhibits. 8. It is apparent that PW-10 and PW-11 were not present in the Patwar-khana when the money was demanded and accepted by the appellant. The prosecution primarily relied on the two witnesses PW-2 and PW-4 respectively who were declared hostile. Certainly the prosecution can rely upon the statements of these witnesses and list their depositions made before the Court by having those statements corroborated or contradicted, as the case may be, by their earlier statements recorded under Section 161 of the I.P.C. At this stage, the finding recorded by the High Court can usefully be referred to: ""PW-2 Smt. Sat Pal Kaur has clearly stated that accused has informed her that Girdawari of her mother's land had been recorded in the name of Jit Singh and others as tenants. She had contacted Jit Singh and others and obtained no objection from them. The said application Ex.PA was forwarded by her through her servant to the Tehsildar. She had contacted Banarsi Dass and requested him to change the said girdawari in her mother's name, who told her that he will do so at the time of recording of khasra girdawari in the next season. She apprehended that he wanted illegal gratification and for that reason, he was not recording the change of girdawari in the name of her mother. She contacted the Police and informed them about the matter. She had visited Patwar-khana, where Banarsi Dass was present and placed Rs. 400/- on his table. In the meantime, police party came and seized that money. She was declared a hostile witness. In cross- examination, she admitted her statement made under Section 161 IPC. She also admitted that Gurmej Singh was not present when Banarsi Dass accused had made a demand of illegal gratification of Rs. 400/-. She admitted that it is correct that Banarsi Dass accused has apologized from her and she had accepted his apology. She further volunteered that it is her humble request to the Court that the Court should also accept the apology of the accused. The police party was sitting in the Thana. So. when the recovery was made by the police from the appellant- accused, somebody must have informed the police about the handing of the bribe and Gurmej Singh was the only person. Shri S.K. Joshi, Sub-Divisional Magistrate, Kalka has appeared as PW10. He has searched Smt. Satpal Kaur and her driver. Gurmej Singh visited the Police Station in the afternoon and complained that Shri Banarsi Dass Patwari Halqa has demanded Rs. 900/- for the correction of Khasra girdawari. Shri Hari Singh recorded the statement of Sat Pal Kaur and made search of her person and after the search, Rs.400/-, which were signed by him and Shri Hari Singh, were given to her. The DSP had prepared memo Ex-PC which was signed by him. He along with DSP, Smt. Sat Pal Kaur and Gurmej Singh went to Police Station Chachrauli and then went to Patwar-khana. Gurmej Singh was directed to come to the Police Station in case the accused accepted the money. After receiving message, they raided Patwar- khana. Accused was found sitting in the Patwar-khana and his person was searched by the DSP in his presence and currency notes Ex.P1 to Ex.P4 were recovered from the front pocket of the shirt, which the accused was wearing. These were taken into possession vide memo Ex.PD. Hari Singh also supported the same. So, if merely shadow witness had turned hostile, accused-appellant cannot be acquitted. Mr. S.K.Joshi ( PW-10) can also be considered as a witness of recovery as currencynotes handed over to Smt. Sat Pal Kaur after being signed by PW-10 and PW-11 vide memo Ex.PC was recovered by DSP (PW-11) vide memo Ex.PD in the presence of Sat Pal Kaur PW-2 and Shri S.K. Joshi, PW-10"". 9. The above findings recorded by the High Court show that the Court relied upon the statements of PW-10 and PW-11. It is further noticed that recovery of currency notes Ex. P-1 to P-4 from the shirt pocket of the accused, examined in light of Ex. PC and PD, there was sufficient evidence to record the finding of guilt against the accused. The Court remained uninfluenced by the fact that the shadow witness had turned hostile, as it was the opinion of the Court that recovery witnesses fully satisfied the requisite ingredients. We must notice that the High Court has fallen in error in so far as it has drawn the inference of demand and receipt of the illegal gratification from the fact that the money was recovered from the accused. 10. It is a settled canon of criminal jurisprudence that the conviction of an accused cannot be founded on the basis of inference. The offence should be proved against the accused beyond reasonable doubt either by direct evidence or even by circumstancial evidence if each link of the chain of events is established pointing towards the guilt of the accused. The prosecution has to lead cogent evidence in that regard. So far as it satisfies the essentials of a complete chain duly supported by appropriate evidence. Applying these tests to the facts of the present case, P-10 and P-11 were neither the eye- witnesses to the demand nor to the acceptance of money by the accused from Smt. Sat Pal Kaur (PW-2). It is unfortunate but true that both PW-2 and PW-4 made statements before the Court which were quite different from the one made by them before the police during the investigation under Section 161 of the IPC. Gurmej Singh (PW-4) completely denied the incident and refused to acknowledge that the sum of Rs. 900/- only was demanded by the accused from PW-2 in his presence and that the money was accepted in the Patwar-khana by the accused. PW-2 obviously has not stated the complete truth before the Court. Though after being declared hostile in her cross-examination she has supported some part of the prosecution case, but she has virtually denied the essential ingredients to bring home the guilt of the accused either under Section 5 (2) of the Act or under Section 161 of the IPC. She seems to have forgiven the accused for making such a demand and made such a statement before the Court that the Court should also ignore the offence. We are not and should not even be taken to have suggested that PW-10 and PW-11 have not made correct statement before the Court or that the Court has disbelieved any part of their statement. But, fact of the matter remains that their statement with regard to demand and acceptance is based on hearsay i.e. what was told to them together by PW-2 and even by PW-4 at that stage. The money was certainly recovered from the pocket of the accused vide memo Ex. P-D. We, therefore, do not accept the contention on behalf of the accused that the amount was not recovered and the recovery is improper in law. Ex. P-D has duly been attested by witnesses. Thus, it cannot be said that the recovery from the pocket of the accused is unsustainable in law and is of no consequence. 11. To constitute an offence under Section 161 of the IPC it is necessary for the prosecution to prove that there was demand of money and the same was voluntarily accepted by the accused. Similarly, in terms of Section 5 (1) (d) of the Act, the demand and acceptance of the money for doing a favour in discharge of its official duties is sine qua non to the conviction of the accused. In the case of M.K. Harshan v. State of Kerala [1996 (11) SCC 720], this Court in somewhat similar circumstances, where the tainted money was kept in the drawer of the accused who denied the same and said that it was put in the drawer without his knowledge, held as under : "".......It is in this context the courts have cautioned that as a rule of prudence, some corroboration is necessary. In all such type of cases of bribery, two aspects are important. Firstly, there must be a demand and secondly there must be acceptance in the sense that the accused has obtained the illegal gratification. Mere demand by itself is not sufficient to establish the offence. Therefore, the other aspect, namely, acceptance is very important and when the accused has come forward with a plea that the currency notes were put in the drawer without his knowledge, then there must be clinching evidence to show that it was with the tacit approval of the accused that the money had been put in the drawer as an illegal gratification. Unfortunately, on this aspect in the present case we have no other evidence except that of PW-1. Since PW-1's evidence suffers from infirmities, we sought to find some corroboration but in vain. There is no other witness or any other circumstance which supports the evidence of PW-1 that this tainted money as a bribe was put in the drawer, as directed by the accused. Unless we are satisfied on this aspect, it is difficult to hold that the accused tacitly accepted the illegal gratification or obtained the same within the meaning of Section 5(1)(d) of the Act, particularly when the version of the accused appears to be probable"". 12. Reliance on behalf of the appellant was placed upon the judgment of this Court in the case of C.M. Girish Babu (supra) where in the facts of the case the Court took the view that mere recovery of money from the accused by itself is not enough in absence of substantive evidence for demand and acceptance. The Court held that there was no voluntary acceptance of the money knowing it to be a bribe and giving advantage to the accused of the evidence on record, the Court in para 18 and 20 of the judgment held as under : ""18. In Suraj Mal v. State (Delhi Admn .) [1979 (4) SCC 725] this Court took the view that (at SCC p. 727, para 2) mere recovery of tainted money divorced from the circumstances under which it is paid is not sufficient to convict the accused when the substantive evidence in the case is not reliable. The mere recovery by itself cannot prove the charge of the prosecution against the accused, in the absence of any evidence to prove payment of bribe or to show that the accused voluntarily accepted the money knowing it to be bribe. 20. A three-Judge Bench in M. Narsinga Rao v. State of A.P. [2001 (1) SCC 691: SCC (Cri) 258] while dealing with the contention that it is not enough that some currency notes were handed over to the public servant to make it acceptance of gratification and prosecution has a further duty to prove that what was paid amounted to gratification, observed: (SCC p. 700, para 24) ""24. ... we think it is not necessary to deal with the matter in detail because in a recent decision rendered by us the said aspect has been dealt with at length. ( Vide Madhukar Bhaskarrao Joshi v. State of Maharashtra [2000 (8) SCC 571]).The following statement made by us in the said decision would be the answer to the aforesaid contention raised by the learned counsel: ( Madhukar case, SCC p. 577, para 12) `12. The premise to be established on the facts for drawing the presumption is that there was payment or acceptance of gratification. Once the said premise is established the inference to be drawn is that the said gratification was accepted ""as motive or reward"" for doing or forbearing to do any official act. So the word ""gratification"" need not be stretched to mean reward because reward is the outcome of the presumption which the court has to draw on the factual premise that there was payment of gratification. This will again be fortified by looking at the collocation of two expressions adjacent to each other like ""gratification or any valuable thing"". If acceptance of any valuable thing can help to draw the presumption that it was accepted as motive or reward for doing or forbearing to do an official act, the word ""gratification"" must be treated in the context to mean any payment for giving satisfaction to the public servant who received it."" 13. In fact, the above principle is no way derivative but is a reiteration of the principle enunciated by this Court in Suraj Mal case (supra), where the Court had held that mere recovery by itself cannot prove the charge of prosecution against the accused in the absence of any evidence to prove payment of bribe or to show that the accused voluntarily accepted the money. Reference can also be made to the judgment of this Court in Sita Ram v. State of Rajasthan [1975 (2) SCC 227], where similar view was taken. 14. The case of C.M. Girish Babu (supra) was registered under the Prevention of Corruption Act, 1988 , Section 7 of which is in pari materia with Section 5 of the Prevention of Corruption Act, 1947. Section 20 of the 1988 Act raises a rebuttable presumption where the public servant accepts gratification other than legal remuneration, which presumption is absent in the 1947 Act. Despite this, the Court followed the principle that mere recovery of tainted money divorced from the circumstances under which it is paid would not be sufficient to convict the accused despite presumption and, in fact, acquitted the accused in that case . 15. In light of the above principles enunciated by the Court now we may examine the evidence on record with specific emphasis to the demand and acceptance of illegal gratification for changing Khasra Girdawaris in the name of mother of Smt. Sat Pal Kaur (PW-2). Besides, the part of her statement which we have aforenoticed, she also stated that she had never made the statement Ex. PW-3/A before the police. Even on the memos which have been signed by her she stated that she had signed them without reading the same. She was educated up to 4th Class only. In her cross-examination she does support a few facts of the prosecution but on the material circumstance/fact she has completely taken a somersault while making a statement before the Court. Gurmej Singh, besides disowning his statement under Section 161 of the IPC in its entirety, stated that he was not present either when the bribe was demanded or when the same was accepted. The accused, when was put to incriminating evidence against him in terms of Section 313 of the Cr.P.C., did admit that PW-2 (complainant) had come to the office of Patwar-khana with the police but stated that no other persons had accompanied them. PW-2 insisted on chaning the Khasra Girdawaris and after she got annoyed, she got him falsely implicated. Money alleged to have been recovered from him, in fact, was lying on the table without his knowledge or demand. PW-2 has also stated in her statement that she kept the money on the table after some altercation with the accused. In these circumstances, it is difficult for the Court to hold that the prosecution has established the offence against the accused, that he accepted the money voluntarily as illegal gratification. The effect of the statement of PW-2 and PW-4 has a substantial adverse effect on the case of the prosecution. There are other witnesses examined by the prosecution which are formal witnesses and in the absence of support of PW-2 and PW-4, the prosecution has not been able to establish the charge (demand and acceptance of illegal gratification by the accused), thus entitling him to some benefit on the technical ground of two witnesses i.e. PW-2 and PW-4, turning hostile. 16. In light of the statement of two hostile witnesses PW-2 and PW-4, the demand and the acceptance of illegal gratification alleged to have been received by the accused for favouring PW-2 by recording the Khasra Girdawaris in the name of her mother cannot be said to have been proved by the prosecution in accordance with law. We make it clear that it is only for the two witnesses having turned hostile and they having denied their statement made under Section 161 of the I.P.C. despite confrontation, that the accused may be entitled to accquital on technical ground. But, in no way we express the opinion that the statement of witnesses including official witnesses PW-10 and PW-11, are not accepted by the Court. Similarly, we have no reason to disbelieve the recovery of Ex. P-1 to P-4 vide Ex. P-D. 17. In the light of this we are of the considered view that the judgment of the High Court convicting the accused for the offences with which the accused was charged cannot be sustained in law. 18. For the reasons aforerecorded and particularly in view of the fact that two witnesses turned hostile, giving the benefit of doubt on technical ground to the accused, we hereby set aside the judgement of the High Court and acquit the accused of both the charges i.e. under Section 161 of the IPC and under Section 5 (2) of the Act. The appeal is accordingly allowed leaving the parties to bear their own costs. Bail bonds, if any, furnished by the appellant be released. .......................J.

Supreme Court of India Oswal Fats And Oils Ltd vs Addl.Commnr.,Bareilly Division & Ors on 1 April, 2010 Author: G.S. Singhvi Bench: Asok Kumar Ganguly , G.S. Singhvi IN THE SUPREME COURT OF INDIA CIVIL APPELLATE JURISDICTION CIVIL APPEAL NO.7982 OF 2002 Oswal Fats and Oils Limited ........Appellant Versus Additional Commissioner (Administration), Bareilly Division, Bareilly and others .......Respondents JUDGMENT G.S. Singhvi, J. 1. Feeling aggrieved by refusal of the learned Single Judge of Allahabad High Court to quash orders dated 24.5.1993 and 30.5.2001 passed by Collector, Pilibhit (for short, `the Collector') and Additional Commissioner (Administration), Bareilly (for short, `the Additional Commissioner') respectively under the U.P. Zamindari Abolition and Land Reforms Act, 1950 (for short, `the Act'), declaring that 27.95 acres land purchased by the appellant in Shahi and Khamaria Pul villages of District Pilibhit shall vest in the State Government, the appellant has filed this appeal. 2 2. The appellant is a company incorporated under Section 149(3) of the Companies Act, 1956. In 1991, the appellant decided to set up agro based paper projects in the State of U.P. By resolution dated 14.10.1991, the Board of Directors of the appellant authorised Shri Kamal Oswal (Director), Shri T.R. Sharma (General Manager) and Shri Jai Prakash Kaushal (Authorised Signatory) to negotiate and finalise purchase of land in the State of Uttar Pradesh and/or other States and Union Territories, to sign sale deeds etc. for effective acquisition/transfer of land. Paragraphs (e) and (f) of that resolution read as under: ""To sign for and on behalf of the company all sales deeds conveyance deeds, Intkals, Mutations and other documents necessary for the effective acquisition/transfer of the land in the name of the company and for this purpose to appear for and on behalf of the company before any court of law, Tehsildar, Naib Tehsildar, Patwari, Registrar, Sub Registrar of any other land transferring authority. And to do all other acts, things and deeds for and on behalf of the company which any of the above noted persons in the discharge of their lawful duties consider proper and in the best interest of the company."" 3. Soon thereafter, an application dated 24.10.1991 was submitted on behalf of the appellant to Joint Director of Industries, Bareilly Zone, Bareilly for grant of permission under Section 154(2) of the Act for purchase of land 3 in excess of 12.5 acres. The relevant portions of that application are extracted below: ""Our Company is proposing to set up a 100 TPD (Gross) Agro based paper project in area adjoining villages of Shahi Kamariapul, Adhkata Nazrana. For this project we require about 200 Acres of land out of which about 50 Acres shall be in Pilibhit District and about 150 Acres in Nawabganj Tehsil of Bareilly District. The proposed paper project shall utilise Agricultural wastes such as wheat Straw, Rice Straw and Bagasse etc. as the main raw materials. The project shall generate direct employment opportunities for about 750 persons and for many more indirectly. The project shall be of special benefit to the people living in the areas near the site. We through this letter are applying to your office for the permission under section 154 of ZALR Act for purchase of land in excess of 12.5 Acres for industrial purpose. We are enclosing two additional copies of this letter. We are also enclosing the site plan, recommendations of Technical Consultants for your ready reference. We shall be pleased to furnish any other information required by you in this connection. We wish to bring to your kind notice that we plan to start the purchase of land for this project from next month i.e. Nov. 1991."" 4. However without waiting for response of the concerned authority, the appellant purchased 40.45 acres land in Shahi and Khamaria Pul villages, Pargana Jahanabad, Tehsil and District Pilibhit through different sale deeds executed between January and April, 1992. 4 5. The State of Uttar Pradesh challenged transfer of various parcels of land in favour of the appellant by filing identical suits under Sections 154 , 167 , 168A and 194 of the Act. The transferors, who were impleaded as parties in all the suits did not contest the same. However, the appellant filed identical written statements in all the cases. In first paragraph of the written statement filed in Suit No.133 of 1993, the appellant admitted all the paragraphs of the suit. In the additional statement, the appellant virtually conceded that the land was purchased in contravention of the Act and stated that it may be allowed to retain 12.5 acres out of the disputed land. This is evinced from English translation of paragraphs 2 to 4 of the written statement which are reproduced below: ""2. That all the lands of both the village had been purchased for establishment of Industry after making the payment to the farmers. But I had the knowledge of law in Punjab and was not well conversant with the provisions of U.P. Zamindari Abolition Act therefore, I purchased the land in question which is more than 12 acres. We had given an application dated 24.10.1991 to the State Government for the permission of establishment of Industry and only thereafter we started purchasing the land without waiting for the permission from the Government because we had the belief that permission will be granted to us for establishment of Industry. 3. That we filed application for mutation of whole of the land under the sale and all of them had been accepted and we continued the purchasing of land because we had the belief that we are not violating any provision of Zamindari Abolition Act. 5 4. That the details of land which we want to keep for the establishment of factory, measuring twelve and a half acres out of the disputed land, are being given in the succeeding paras and we have no objection for any legal action with regard to the remaining land."" The particulars of the land suit sought to be retained by the appellant were given in the affidavit of Shri T.R. Sharma. A sketch map showing those khasra numbers were also filed with the written statement. 6. By an order dated 24.5.1993, the Collector declared that the purchase made by the appellant in excess of 12.50 acres is against the provisions of Sections 154 / 167 of the Act and that it will be entitled to retain only 12.50 acres and the remaining land measuring 27.95 acres would vest in the State Government. The relevant portion of the order passed by the Collector is extracted below: ""I have heard the arguments of Government Counsel (Revenue) for State and the learned counsel for M/s. Oswal Fats and Oil Limited and perused the records. After hearing the arguments of both the parties and the perusal of records, I have reached on the conclusion that the defendants M/s. Oswal Fats and Oil Limited, New Delhi have purchased the total land measuring 40.45 Acres in Village Shahi and Khamaria Pul, Pargana Jahanabad, Tehsil and District Pilibhit, as detailed above. However as per the provisions of Section 154/167 of Jamindari Abolition and Land Management Act, they can possess only 12.50 Acres land. Therefore, the transfer of remaining land measuring 27.95 Acres, which is in excess than 12.50 Acres, is against the provisions of Section 154/167 of Z.A. Act. The 6 defendant Company Oswal Fats and Oil Limited has also given the option for 12.50 Acres land, in their affidavit. Therefore, the remaining land except the 12.50 Acres land mentioned in the Affidavit dated 19.05.93 is liable to be merged into the State."" 7. The appellant questioned the order of the Collector by filing revision under Section 333 of the Act. In the memo of revision, it was claimed that excess land was purchased under the belief that the State Government would grant permission under Section 154(2) . It was then urged that although the Board of Directors had given power to Shri T.R. Sharma to appear before any court of law on behalf of the appellant, he was not authorized to enter into a compromise or give consent for retaining the particular land. Another plea taken by the appellant was that the company consists of 8 directors and if each Director is entitled to have a share of 12.5 acres, the purchase made by the appellant will not exceed the prescribed limit. However, at the hearing of the revision petition, the plea that Shri T.R. Sharma had filed written statement and affidavit beyond the scope of his authority appears to have been given up and it was submitted that the general manager had been authorised to pursue the case but he did not do it properly. The Additional Commissioner dismissed the revision of the appellant and confirmed the order of the Collector by recording following reasons: 7 ""It is clear from the perusal of records that the defendants themselves have admitted in their objections filed before the court below that the land in question had been purchased for establishment of Industry and purchased the land more than 12.50 acres intentionally. They have also given the details of land which they want to keep with them and agree for merging of remaining land into the State. Revisionist has stated that they had given an application for obtaining the permission and it has also been admitted that they had purchased the land in excess than 12.50 acres without waiting for the permission. In these circumstances, the court below has correctly passed an order for merging of 27.95 Acre land into the State, which is in excess than the 12.50 acres land and this order does not require any intervention. Therefore, the Revision, being devoid of merits, is liable to be dismissed."" 8. The appellant challenged the orders of the Collector and the Additional Commissioner in Writ Petition No.25819/2001 by taking up the position that Shri T.R. Sharma was not authorised to enter into a compromise or to make a statement relinquishing the land in favour of the State Government. It was also pleaded that the appellant was entitled to purchase land in excess of 12.50 acres because its case is covered by the explanation appearing below Section 154(1) of the Act. 9. The learned Single Judge rejected the argument on the issue of lack of authority of Shri T.R. Sharma to indirectly admit violation of Section 154(1) of the Act and to agree to surrender excess land by making the following observations: 8 ""It is apparent on face of record that petitioner Company has no authorization either general or special to hold land in excess of 12.50 acres by State Government. Indisputably the petitioner Company is not a Co-operative Society registered under the Co- operative Societies Act nor petitioner Company is established for charitable purposes. Nothing is brought to my notice that the present Company is established in the interest of general public. Contrary to it, there are overwhelming materials on record and also from attending circumstances it is inferable that the petitioner Company is an establishment established with profit orientation for its shareholders. It is pertinent to mention here that the petitioner Company has not produced its certificate of registration under the Companies Act . During the course of argument articles of association of Nuskar Enterprises Ltd. is produced by the learned counsel for the petitioner. It is not understandable as to why the certificate of registration under the Companies Act is not produced before the Court. It is also not understandable as to how the Articles of Association of Nuskar Enterprises Ltd. has nexus with the petitioner Company. I am of the view that even if the affidavit dated 19.5.1993 (Annexure-7 to the writ petition) of the General Manager of the petitioner Company giving consent to relinquish the land in excess of 12.50 acres in favour of State Government is ignored even then the findings of respondents No.1 and 2 are sustainable for the reasons given hereinabove."" The learned Single Judge then referred to the provisions of Sections 152 , 154 , 166 and 167 of the Act and held that the purchase made by the appellant in excess of 12.50 acres was illegal per se and its case does not fall within the ambit of the exceptions carved out in sub-section (2) of Section 154. The learned Single Judge rejected the appellant's plea that surrender made by Shri T.R. Sharma was unauthorized and held that the Collector did 9 not commit any illegality by declaring that excess land will vest in the State Government. Simultaneously, he gave a direction to the Chief Secretary to ensure that possession of the excess land is taken by the Government free from all encumbrances without any delay. 10. At this stage, we may mention that during the pendency of the suits filed by the State Government before the Collector, the appellant instituted Suit No.25/1992-93 under Section 143 of the Act, which was disposed of by Pargana Adhikari, Pilibhit vide her order dated 12.7.1993 by declaring that 7.97 acres land purchased by the appellant in Tehsil and District Pilibhit was non-agricultural land. 11. Shri Manoj Swarup, learned counsel for the appellant argued that the order passed by the Collector was vitiated due to violation of the basics of natural justice inasmuch as the concerned officer did not give reasonable opportunity to the appellant to defend its case on the issue of alleged violation of Section 154 of the Act and the Additional Commissioner and the learned Single Judge gravely erred in confirming/upholding the order of the Collector. The learned counsel further argued that Shri T.R. Sharma, who was holding the post of General Manager was not authorised to make any 10 concession on behalf of the appellant or give consent for surrendering 27.95 acres land on the ground that the purchase of land was made in violation of mandate of Section 154 and the Collector was not at all justified in acting upon the concession made by Shri T.R. Sharma. Learned counsel then referred to Section 154 of the Act and submitted that the embargo contained in that section is not applicable to the appellant's case because purchase made by a company does not fall within the ambit of that section. The learned counsel reiterated the plea that if each director of the company is held entitled to purchase 12.50 acres of land, the purchase of 40.45 acres land by the appellant cannot be treated as violation of Section 154(1) . He lastly argued that even if transfer of land in favour of the appellant is held to be contrary to the mandate of Section 154(1) , the Court may direct the State Government to accord post facto sanction in terms of sub-section (3) of Section 154 which was inserted by an amendment dated 24.3.2005. Learned counsel also criticized the direction given by the High Court to the Chief Secretary to take possession of the excess land and submitted that while deciding the writ petition filed by the appellant against the orders of the Collector and the Additional Commissioner, the learned Single Judge was not justified in treating the case as a public interest litigation. 11 12. Shri T.N. Singh, learned counsel appearing for the respondents supported the impugned order and argued that the Collector did not commit any error by declaring that the excess land will vest in the State Government because the purchase was made by the appellant without obtaining permission in terms of Section 154 of the Act. Learned counsel relied upon the averments contained in the written statement filed on behalf of the appellant in Suit No. 133/1993 and argued that after having indirectly admitted contravention of Section 154(1) of the Act, the appellant did not have the locus to challenge the orders of the Collector and the Additional Commissioner on the ground that Shri T.R. Sharma was not authorized to give option for retaining the particular parcels of land and the learned Single Judge rightly held that the transfers made in violation of Section 154 were null and void. 13. Before dealing with the respective arguments/submissions, we consider it appropriate to note that after one year and five months of passing of order by the Collector, the appellant and the State Government entered into a lease agreement dated 15.10.1994 whereby the latter agreed to give excess land measuring 27.95 acres, the details of which were given in Schedule `A' appended to the agreement, to the appellant on lease for a 12 period of 30 years at an yearly rent of Rs.281.05. The lease agreement was signed on behalf of the appellant by Shri Kamal Oswal, Director and Shri J.P. Kaushal, General Manager (Liaison). In the lease agreement, a copy of which has been annexed as Annexure CA-1 with the counter affidavit filed on behalf of the respondents in this Court, the lessee i.e., the appellant candidly admitted that transfers made in its favour by the Bhumidhars were contrary to Section 154 of the Act and were void and, as such, land vested in the State Government under Section 167 . This is evinced from the following paragraphs of the lease agreement: ""AND WHEREAS the transfers as aforesaid made by the Bhumidhars in favour of the Lessee in respect of the land described in Schedule `A' hereto being in contravention of Section 154 of the Uttar Pradesh Jamindari Abolition and Land Reforms Act, 1950 (hereinafter called ""the said Act"") were void under Section 166 of the said Act and consequently the said land vested in the Government of Uttar Pradesh (hereinafter called ""the State Government"") under Section 167 of the said Act, free from all encumbrances with effect from the date of their transfer. AND WHEREAS the lessor at the request of the Lessee has agree to demise and land vested in the State Government as aforementioned subject to the rights and restrictions and the several convenants hereinafter expressed for the purposes of the said project."" (emphasis supplied) 13 14. It is quite intriguing and surprising that the lease agreement was not brought to the notice of the Additional Commissioner and the learned Single Judge of the High Court and neither of them was apprised of the fact that the appellant had taken 27.95 acres land on lease from the Government by unequivocally conceding that it had purchased excess land in violation of Section 154(1) of the Act and the same vested in the State Government. In the list of dates and the memo of special leave petition filed in this Court also there is no mention of lease agreement dated 15.10.1994. This shows that the appellant has not approached the Court with clean hands. The withholding of the lease agreement from the Additional Commissioner, the High Court and this Court appears to be a part of the strategy adopted by the appellant to keep the quasi-judicial and judicial forums including this Court in dark about the nature of its possession over the excess land and make them believe that it has been subjected to unfair treatment. If the factum of execution of lease agreement and its contents were disclosed to the Additional Commissioner, he would have definitely incorporated the same in order dated 30.5.2001. In that event, the High Court or for that reason this Court would have non suited the appellant at the threshold. However, by concealing a material fact, the appellant succeeded in persuading the High Court and this Court to entertain adventurous litigation instituted by it and 14 pass interim orders. If either of the courts had been apprised of the fact that by virtue of lease deed dated 15.10.1994, the appellant has succeeded in securing temporary legitimacy for its possession over excess land, then there would have been no occasion for the High Court or this Court to entertain the writ petition or the special leave petition. 15. It is settled law that a person who approaches the Court for grant of relief, equitable or otherwise, is under a solemn obligation to candidly disclose all the material/important facts which have bearing on the adjudication of the issues raised in the case. In other words, he owes a duty to the court to bring out all the facts and refrain from concealing/suppressing any material fact within his knowledge or which he could have known by exercising diligence expected of a person of ordinary prudence. If he is found guilty of concealment of material facts or making an attempt to pollute the pure stream of justice, the court not only has the right but a duty to deny relief to such person. In one of the earliest decisions on the subject i.e., - R. v. Kensington Income Tax Commissioner (1917) 1 KB 486, Viscount Reading, Chief Justice of the Divisional Court observed: ""Where an ex parte application has been made to this Court for a rule nisi or other process, if the Court comes to the conclusion that the affidavit in support of the applicant was not candid and did not fairly state the facts, the Court ought, for its own 15 protection and to prevent an abuse of its process, to refuse to proceed any further with the examination of the merits. This is a power inherent in the Court, but one which should only be used in cases which bring conviction to the mind of the Court that it has been deceived. Before coming to this conclusion a careful examination will be made of the facts as they are and as they have been stated in the applicant's affidavit, and everything will be heard that can be urged to influence the view of the Court when it reads the affidavit and knows the true facts. But if the result of this examination and hearing is to leave no doubt that this Court has been deceived, then it will refuse to hear anything further from the applicant in a proceeding which has only been set in motion by means of a misleading affidavit."" 16. The above extracted observations were approved by the Court of Appeal in the following words: ""It is the duty of a party asking for an injunction to bring under the notice of the Court all facts material to the determination of his right to that injunction: and it is no excuse for him to say that he was not aware of the importance of any facts which he has omitted to bring forward. If an applicant does not act with uberrima fides and put every material fact before the Court it will not grant him an injunction, even though there might be facts upon which the injunction might be granted."" His Lordship rightly pronounced: ""The Court, for its own protection, is entitled to say: We refuse this writ... without going into the merits of the case on the ground of the conduct of the applicant in bringing the case before us."" Warrington, L.J. was also of the same opinion. In a concurring judgment His Lordship observed: ""It is perfectly well settled that a person who makes an ex parte application to the Court - that is to say, in absence of the person who will be affected by that which the Court is asked to do - is under an obligation to the Court to make the fullest possible disclosure of all material facts within his knowledge, and if he does not make that fullest possible disclosure, then he cannot obtain any advantage from the 16 proceedings, and he will be deprived of any advantage he may have already obtained by means of the order which has thus wrongly been obtained by him."" 17. This Court and different High Courts have repeatedly invoked and applied the rule that a person who does not disclose all material facts has no right to be heard on the merits of his grievance - State of Haryana v. Karnal Distillery Co. Ltd. (1977) 2 SCC 431, Vijay Kumar Kathuria v. State of Haryana ( 1983) 3 SCC 333, Welcome Hotel and others v. State of Andhra Pradesh and others etc. (1983) 4 SCC 575, G. Narayanaswamy Reddy (dead) by LRs. and another v. Government of Karnataka and another ( 1991) 3 SCC 261, S.P. Chengalvaraya Naidu (dead) by L.Rs. v. Jagannath (dead) by LRs. and others (1994) 1 SCC 1, Agricultural and Processed Food Products v. Oswal Agro Furane and others ( 1996) 4 SCC 297, Union of India and others v. Muneesh Suneja ( 2001) 3 SCC 92, Prestige Lights Ltd. v. State Bank of India ( 2007) 8 SCC 449, Sunil Poddar and others v. Union Bank of India ( 2008) 2 SCC 326, K.D. Sharma v. Steel Authority of India Ltd. and others ( 2008) 12 SCC 481, G. Jayshree and others v. Bhagwandas S. Patel and others (2009) 3 SCC 141 and C.A. No. 5239/2002 - Dalip Singh v. State of U.P. and others , decided on 3.12.2009. 17 18. In Hari Narain v. Badri Das AIR 1963 S.C. 1558, this Court revoked the leave granted to the appellant by making following observations: ""It is of utmost importance that in making material statements and setting forth grounds in applications for special leave made under Article 136 of the Constitution, care must be taken not to make any statements which are inaccurate, untrue and misleading. In dealing with applications for special leave, the Court naturally takes statements of fact and grounds of fact contained in the petitions at their face value and it would be unfair to betray the confidence of the Court by making statements which are untrue and misleading. Thus, if at the hearing of the appeal the Supreme Court is satisfied that the material statements made by the appellant in his application for special leave are inaccurate and misleading, and the respondent is entitled to contend that the appellant may have obtained special leave from the Supreme Court on the strength of what he characterizes as misrepresentations of facts contained in the petition for special leave, the Supreme Court may come to the conclusion that in such a case special leave granted to the appellant ought to be revoked."" 19. In Dalip Singh 's case, the appellant's grievance was that before finalizing the case under the U.P. Imposition of Ceiling on Land Holdings Act, 1960 , the prescribed authority did not give notice to the tenure holder Shri Praveen Singh (predecessor of the appellant). On a scrutiny of the records, this Court found that the prescribed authority had issued notice to Shri Praveen Singh, which was duly served upon him and held that the appellant is not entitled to relief because he did not approach the High Court with clean hands inasmuch as he made a misleading statement in the writ 18 petition giving an impression that the tenure holder did not know of the proceedings initiated by the prescribed authority. The preface and para 21 of that judgment read as under: ""For many centuries, Indian society cherished two basic values of life i.e., `Satya' (truth) and `Ahimsa' (non-violence). Mahavir, Gautam Buddha and Mahatma Gandhi guided the people to ingrain these values in their daily life. Truth constituted an integral part of justice delivery system which was in vogue in pre-independence era and the people used to feel proud to tell truth in the courts irrespective of the consequences. However, post-independence period has seen drastic changes in our value system. The materialism has over-shadowed the old ethos and the quest for personal gain has become so intense that those involved in litigation do not hesitate to take shelter of falsehood, misrepresentation and suppression of facts in the court proceedings. In last 40 years, a new creed of litigants has cropped up. Those who belong to this creed do not have any respect for truth. They shamelessly resort to falsehood and unethical means for achieving their goals. In order to meet the challenge posed by this new creed of litigants, the courts have, from time to time, evolved new rules and it is now well established that a litigant, who attempts to pollute the stream of justice or who touches the pure fountain of justice with tainted hands, is not entitled to any relief, interim or final. 21. From what we have mentioned above, it is clear that in this case efforts to mislead the authorities and the courts have transmitted through three generations and the conduct of the appellant and his son to mislead the High Court and this Court cannot, but be treated as reprehensible. They belong to the category of persons who not only attempt, but succeed in polluting the course of justice. Therefore, we do not find any justification to interfere with the order under challenge or entertain the appellant's prayer for setting aside the orders passed by the Prescribed Authority and the Appellate Authority."" 19 20. Notwithstanding our conclusion that the appellant is guilty of contumacious conduct and is not entitled to any relief, we have thought it proper to deal with the argument advanced by the learned counsel for the appellant on the issues of violation of rules of natural justice and non applicability of Section 154 of the Act. 21. The question whether the appellant was denied reasonable opportunity to defend its cause needs consideration in the light of the written statements filed on behalf of the appellant before the Collector, wherein it was admitted that land had been purchased without waiting for the permission of the Government under the belief that permission will be granted for establishing the industry. Not only this, it was candidly stated that the appellant has no objection if any legal action is taken with regard to land in excess of 12.50 acres. In the proceedings of the suits, no prayer was made on behalf of the appellant for permission to lead evidence to prove that the purchase made by it from Bhumidhars was not in violation of Section 154(1) of the Act. Before the Additional Commissioner and the High Court, the appellant did not make a grievance that the Collector had passed order without giving it a reasonable or effective opportunity of hearing. In this view of the matter, 20 the appellant cannot now contend that the Collector did not act in consonance with the rule of audi alteram partem. 22. Though, Shri Manoj Swarup made strenuous efforts to convince the Court that Shri T.R. Sharma had no authority to make tacit admission of the illegality committed in the purchase of land and that he had no right to make an offer for surrender of excess land, we have not felt impressed. A reading of resolution dated 14.10.1991 makes it clear that Shri T.R. Sharma, the then General Manager of the appellant was authorised to take all actions necessary for transfer of land. That apart, in view of lease agreement dated 15.10.1994, which was not produced by the appellant before the Additional Commissioner, the learned Single Judge of the High Court and even this Court (for the first time, the lease agreement came to the fore when a copy thereof was annexed with the counter affidavit filed on behalf of the respondent), challenge to the competence of Sri T.R. Sharma to make an admission that the land was purchased by the appellant without waiting for the State Government's permission and that appropriate legal action can be taken with regard to excess land pales into the realm of insignificance. The learned counsel was at loss to explain as to how in the face of the lease agreement, which was signed by none else than Shri Kamal Oswal (Director 21 of the appellant), whose name finds mention in Resolution dated 14.10.1991 and General Manager (Liaison) and which contains unequivocal admission that the land was purchased in violation of Section 154(1) and, as such, the transaction was void and that by virtue of Section 167 , excess land vested in the State Government, it can be said that Shri T.R. Sharma acted beyond his authority in filing the written statement. This being the position, it is not possible to find any fault with the order of the Collector who relied upon the written statement filed on behalf of the appellant and declared that land in excess of 12.50 acres will vest in the State Government. 23. We shall now consider whether the restriction contained in Section 154(1) is not attracted in a case involving transfer of land by Bhumidhar in favour of a company. In this context, it is important to bear in mind that the Act was enacted by the State Legislature to achieve the goal of social and economic justice enshrined in the preamble of the Constitution. It provides for abolition of zamindari system, which involves intermediaries between tiller of the soil and the State and for acquisition of their rights, title and interest and to reform the law relating to land tenure. Sections 154 , 166 and 167 of the Act, which contain restriction on transfer of land by Bhumidhar 22 and also specify the consequences of transfer made in violation of that restriction, read as under:- ""154. Restriction on transfer by a bhumidhar.- (1) Save as provided in sub-section (2), no bhumidhar shall have the right to transfer by sale or gift, any land other than tea gardens to any person where the transferee shall, as a result of such sale or gift, become entitled to land which together with land if any, held by his family will, in the aggregate, exceed 5.0586 hectares (12.50 acres) in Uttar Pradesh. Explanation.- For the removal of doubt it is hereby declared that in this sub-section the expression `person' shall include and be deemed to have included on June 15, 1976 a `Co-operative Society': Provided that where the transferee is a co-operative society, the land held by it having been pooled by its members under clause (a) of sub-section (1) of section 77 of the Uttar Pradesh Co- operative Societies Act, 1965 shall not be taken into account in computing the 5.0586 hectares (12.50 acres) land held by it. (2) Subject to the provisions of any other law relating to the land tenures for the time being in force, the State Government may, by general or special order, authorise transfer in excess of the limit prescribed in sub-section (1) if it is of the opinion that such transfer is in favour of a registered cooperative society or an institution established for a charitable purpose, which does not have land sufficient for its need or that the transfer is in the interest of general public. Explanation.- For the purposes of this section, the expression `family' shall mean the transferee, his or her wife or husband (as the case may be) and minor children, and where the transferee is a minor also his or her parents. 23 (3) For every transfer of land in excess of the limit prescribed under sub-section (1) prior approval of the State Government shall be necessary: Provided that where the prior approval of the State Government is not obtained under this sub-section, the State Government may on an application give its approval afterward in such manner and on payment in such manner of an amount, as fine, equal to twenty-five per cent of the cost of the land as may be prescribed. The cost of the land shall be such as determined by the Collector for stamp duty. Provided further that where the State Government is satisfied that any transfer has been made in public interest, it may exempt any such transferee from the payment of fine under this sub-section. 166. Transfer made in contravention of the Act to be void.- Every transfer made in contravention of the provisions of this Act shall be void. 167. Consequences of void transfers.- (1) The following consequences shall ensue in respect of every transfer which is void by virtue of section 166 , namely- (a) the subject-matter of transfer shall with effect from the date of transfer, be deemed to have vested in the State Government free from all encumbrances; (b) the trees, crops and wells existing on the land on the date of transfer shall, with effect from the said date, be deemed to have vested in the State Government free from all encumbrances; (c) the transferee may remove other movable property or the materials of any immovable property existing on such land on the date of transfer within such time as may be prescribed. (2) Where any land or other property has vested in the State Government under sub-section (1), it shall be lawful for the 24 Collector to take over possession over such land or other property and to direct that any person occupying such land or property be evicted therefrom. For the purposes of taking over such possession or evicting such unauthorised occupants, the Collector may use or cause to be used such force as may be necessary."" 24. While enacting law for abolition of zamindari system, the legislature was aware of the ground reality that despite the welfare measures which may be taken by the State to protect the interest of poor farmers, economically affluent class of people may persuade or pressurize them to part with their sole source of sustenance i.e., the land. This is the reason why a ceiling has been imposed on transfer of land by Bhumidhar. Section 154(1) , in no uncertain terms, declares that no Bhumidhar shall be entitled to transfer any land other than tea gardens by sale or gift to any person if holding of the transferee would exceed 12.50 acres (Earlier the prescribed limit was 30 acres but by an amendment it was reduced to 12.50 acres). An explanation was subsequently added to clarify that the word `person' shall include and be deemed to have included a cooperative society on June 15, 1976. Proviso to Section 154(1) lays down that where the transferee is a cooperative society, the land held by it having been pooled by its members under Section 77(1)(a) of the Uttar Pradesh Cooperative Societies Act, 1965 shall not be taken into account for the purpose of computing 12.50 acres. Under sub- 25 section (2), the State Government is empowered to authorize transfer of land in excess of the limit prescribed in sub-section (1) if it is of the opinion that such transfer is in favour of a registered cooperative society or an institution established for a charitable purpose, which does not have sufficient land for its need or the transfer is in the interest of general public. The substantive part of sub-section (3), which was added by an amendment made in 2005, lays down that every transfer of land in excess of the limit prescribed under sub-section (1) shall require prior approval of the State Government. By virtue of proviso to this sub-section, the State Government has been clothed with power to give post facto approval on payment of the specified amount as fine. Section 166 declares that every transfer made in contravention of the provision of the Act shall be void. This obviously includes Section 154(1) . Section 167 enumerates the consequences of void transfers. Clause (a) of Section 167(1) lays down that a transfer which is void by virtue of Section 166 , the subject matter of transfer shall be deemed to have vested in the State Government from the date of transfer. In terms of Section 167(2) , the Collector is entitled to take over possession of any land or other property which has vested in the State Government under sub-section (1) and also direct eviction of any person occupying such land or property. 26 25. The argument of Shri Manoj Swarup that a company is not a `person' within the meaning of Section 154(1) of the Act and, therefore, the restriction contained therein is not applicable to transfer of land in favour of a company sans merit. Since, the word `person' has not been defined in the Act, reference can usefully be made to the definition of that word in the Uttar Pradesh General Clauses Act, 1904 . Sections 3 and 4(33) of that Act read as under: ""3. Application of the Act to other enactments. - (1) The provisions of this Act shall apply to this Act and to all Uttar Pradesh Acts, whether made before or after the commencement of this Act. (2) The provisions of this Act in their application to any enactment or statutory instrument shall be subject to any contrary requirements of the context of the enactment or instrument that is to be interpreted. 4. Definitions. - In all Uttar Pradesh Acts, unless there is anything repugnant in the subject or context, - xxxx xxxx xxxx (33) ""Person"" shall include any company or association or body of individuals, whether incorporated or not; xxxx xxxx xxxx"" A reading of Section 3(1) reproduced above makes it clear that the provisions contained in the U.P. General Clauses Act are applicable to all Uttar Pradesh Acts including the Act with which we are concerned. To put 27 it differently, by virtue of Section 3(1) of the General Clauses Act, the definition of the word `person' contained in Section 4(33) will be deemed to have been engrafted in the Act and the same cannot be given a restricted meaning as suggested by the learned counsel. Rather, in view of the definition contained in Section 4(33) of the U.P. General Clauses Act, the word `person' appearing in Section 154(1) would include any company or association or body of individuals, whether incorporated or not. This view of ours is strengthened by the language of explanation added to Section 154(1) whereby it was declared that the expression `person' shall include a cooperative society. The word `include' is generally used in interpretation clauses in order to enlarge the meaning of the words or phrases occurring in the body of the statue and when it is so used those words or phrases must be construed as comprehending, not only such things, as they signify according to their natural import, but also those things which the interpretation clause declares that they shall include. The word `include' is susceptible of another construction, which may become imperative, if the context of the Act is sufficient to show that it was not merely employed for the purpose of adding to the natural significance of the words or expressions used. It may be equivalent to `mean and include' and in that case it may afford an exhaustive explanation of the meaning which for the purposes of the Act must 28 invariably be attached to those words or expressions. - Dilworth v.

Hospital Mazdoor Sabha and others AIR 1960 SC 610, Gajendragadkar, J., observed: ""It is obvious that the words used in an inclusive definition denote extension and cannot be treated as restricted in any sense. Where we are dealing with an inclusive definition, it would be inappropriate to put a restrictive interpretation upon terms of wider denotation. In CIT, A.P. v. Taj Mahal Hotel, Secunderabad (1971) 3 SCC 550, this Court interpreted the word `plant' used in Section 10(2) (vi-b) of the Income Tax Act, 1922 . Speaking for the Court, Grover, J., observed: ""The very fact that even books have been included shows that the meaning intended to be given to `plant' is wide. The word `includes' is often used in interpretation clauses in order to enlarge the meaning of the words or phrases occurring in the body of the statute. When it is so used these words and phrases must be construed as comprehending not only such things as they signify according to their nature and import but also those things which the interpretation clause declares that they shall include."" 26. Moreover, if the word `person' used in Section 154(1) is interpreted keeping in view the object of legislation and by applying the rule of contextual interpretation, the applicability of which has been recognised in Poppatlal Shah v. State of Madras AIR 1953 SC 274 (para 7), S.K. Gupta 29 and another v. K.P. Jain and another ( 1979) 3 SCC 54 (para 25), Reserve Bank of India v. Peerless General Finance and Investment Co. Ltd. and others (1987) 1 SCC 424 (para 33) and Central Bank of India v. State of Kerala and others (2009) 4 SCC 94 (para 98), it becomes clear that the same would include human being and a body of individuals which may have juridical or non juridical status. 27. At the cost of repetition, we consider it appropriate to observe that the primary object of Section 154(1) is to put a restriction/ceiling on the transfer of land by a Bhumidhar to any other person by sale or gift. Though, sub- sections (2) and (3) of Section 154 empowers the Government to dilute the rigor of the restriction contained in Section 154(1) , if that section is read in conjunction with Sections 166 and 167 which provide for consequences of transfer made in contravention of the Act including Section 154(1) , the word `person' appearing in Section 154(1) cannot be construed in a manner which would defeat the object and purpose of legislation. If a narrow meaning is given to the word `person' appearing in Section 154(1) , the purpose of legislation viz., abolition of zamindari and making tillers owner of the land, which is in consonance with the mandate of the object of social justice set out in the preamble and the provisions contained in Articles 38 and 39 of the 30 Constitution, would be substantively defeated because in that event companies, corporations, etc. will be able to grab the land of the tillers by offering them comparatively remunerative prices and again make them landless poor. 28. At this stage, we may notice two precedents which have direct bearing on the interpretation of word `person'. In Hasmukhlal Dahayabhai and others v. State of Gujarat and others (1976) 4 SCC 100, this Court was called upon to interpret Section 6 of the Gujarat Ceiling Act, 1961. It was argued on behalf of the appellant that the concept of person embodied in Section 6(2) was contrary to the concept of that word in second proviso to Article 331A(1) of the Constitution. While repelling the challenge, this Court observed: ""It is evident that Section 6 conceives of each ""person"" holding land as a single unit whose holding must not exceed the ceiling limit. Section 2 sub-section (21) says: "" `person' includes a joint family"",. Thus, the term ""person"" is not, strictly speaking, defined in the Act. Section 2 sub-section (21) only clarifies that the term ""person"" will ""include"" a joint family also. It certainly does not exclude an individual from being a person in the eyes of law. This has been done apparently to make it clear that, in addition to individuals, as natural persons, families, as conceived of by other provisions, can also be and are persons. This elucidation of the term ""person"" is in keeping with Section 3(42) of the General Clauses Act, 1897, which lays down: "" 31 `person' shall include any company or association or body of individuals, whether incorporated or not"". We have referred to the Central General Clauses Act 10 of 1897 and not to the State General Clauses Act , which also contains a similar clarification, because Article 367 of our Constitution provides that the definitions contained in the Central Act ""apply for the interpretation of the Constitution"". The argument which has been advanced before us is that the concept of the term ""person"", having been fixed by the Central General Clauses Act, this concept and no other must be used for interpreting the second proviso to Article 31-A(1) of the Constitution which lays down: ""Provided further that where any law makes any provision for the acquisition by the State of any estate and where any land comprised therein is held by a person under his personal cultivation, it shall not be lawful for the State to acquire any portion of such land as is within the ceiling limit applicable to him under any law for the time being in force or any building or structure standing thereon or appurtenant thereto, unless the law relating to the acquisition of such land, building or structure, provides for payment of compensation at a rate which shall not be less than the market value thereof."" It is true that, but for the provisions of Section 6 , sub- section (2) of the Act, the term ""person"", which includes individuals, as natural persons, as well as groups or bodies of individuals, as artificial persons, such as a family is, the entitlement to the ceiling area would be possessed by every person, whether artificial or natural. In other words, if Section 6(2) of the Act was not there, each individual member of a family would have been entitled to hold land upto the ceiling limit if it was his or her legally separate property. This follows from the obvious meaning of the term ""person"" as well as the inclusive definitions given both in the Act under consideration and in the General Clauses Act . 32 Spouses and minor children, as natural persons, have not been debarred from holding their separate rights to land by the provisions of the Act. It is not the object of the Act to do that. The object of the Act, as set out above, is twofold: firstly, to limit the ceiling area of each holder; and, secondly, to acquire what falls beyond the ceiling limit so that the State may distribute it to more needy persons. It is not disputed that compensation is provided for acquisition of what exceeds the ceiling area in every case. As was held by this Court in H.H. Kesavananda Bharati Sripadagalavaru v. State of Kerala the amount of compensation fixed cannot be questioned. Therefore, no provision of the Act could be or is challenged on the ground that the required compensation is not prescribed for an acquisition under it as required by Article 31(2) of the Constitution or is inadequate."" 29. The issue was recently considered in Ramanlal Bhailal Patel v. State of Gujarat (2008) 5 SCC 449. That case involved interpretation of the provisions contained in the Gujarat Agricultural Land Ceiling Act, 1960 . The High Court held that the word `person' appearing in Section 6 of the Act includes an association of persons and as such 10 co-owners were entitled to only one unit i.e. 36 acres. It was argued on behalf of the appellant that the definition of ""person"" in the General Clauses Act cannot be read into the definition of ""person"" in the Ceiling Act and in any case co- owners cannot be considered as a body of individuals or association of persons and each co-owner should be considered as a person for the purposes of the Ceiling Act. The Court referred to the provisions of Gujarat 33 General Clauses Act , which is pari materia to the General Clauses Act, 1897 and held: ""The extent of land that could be held by the appellants depends upon the interpretation of the word ""person"" in Section 6(1) of the Ceiling Act which provides that ""no person shall ... be entitled to hold ... land in excess of the ceiling area"". If the ten co-owners are considered as an ""association of persons"" or ""body of individuals"", and consequently as a ""person"", then the ten co-owners together as a person, will be entitled to only one unit of land which is the ceiling area per person. But if ""association of persons"" or ""body of individuals"" is not a ""person"", or if a co-ownership is not an association of person/body of individuals, then each co-owner or the family of each co-owner, as the case may be will be a separate ""person"" having regard to the definition of person in Section 2(21) of the Ceiling Act, in which event, each family will be entitled to hold one unit of land. The word ""person"" is defined in the Act, but it is an inclusive definition, that is, ""a person includes a joint family"". Where the definition is an inclusive definition, the use of the word ""includes"" indicates an intention to enlarge the meaning of the word used in the statute. Consequently, the word must be construed as comprehending not only such things which they signify according to their natural import, but also those things which the interpretation clause declares that they shall include. Thus, where a definition uses the word ""includes"", as contrasted from ""means"", the word defined not only bears its ordinary, popular and natural meaning, but in addition also bears the extended statutory meaning (see S.K. Gupta v. K.P. Jain following Dilworth v. Commr. of Stamps and Jobbins v. Middlesex Country Council). The ordinary, popular and natural meaning of the word ""person"" is ""a specific individual human being"". But in law the 34 word ""person"" has a slightly different connotation and refers to any entity that is recognised by law as having the rights and duties of a human being. Salmond defines ""person"" as ""any being whom the law regards as capable of rights and duties"" or as ""a being, whether human or not, of which rights and duties are the attributes"" (Jurisprudence, 12th Edn., p. 299). Thus the word ""person"", in law, unless otherwise intended, refers not only to a natural person (male or female human being), but also any legal person (that is an entity that is recognised by law as having or capable of having rights and duties). The General Clauses Act thus defines a ""person"" as including a corporation or an association of persons or a body of individuals whether incorporated or not. The said general legal definition is, however, either modified or restricted or expanded in different statutes with reference to the object of the enactment or the context in which it is used. For instance, the definition of the word ""person"" in the Income Tax Act , is very wide and includes an individual, a Hindu Undivided Family, a company, a firm, an association of persons or body of individuals whether incorporated or not, a local authority and every other artificial juridical person. At the other extreme is the Citizenship Act , Section 2(f) of which reads thus: ` ""Person"" does not include any company or association or body of individuals whether incorporated or not.' Similarly, the definition under Section 2(g) of the Representation of People Act, 1950, is ""person"" does not include a body of persons. Both definitions of the word ""person"", in the General Clauses Act and the Ceiling Act, are inclusive definitions. The inclusive definition of ""person"" in the General Clauses Act applies to all Gujarat Acts unless there is anything repugnant in the subject or the context. The inclusive definition of ""person"" in Section 2(21) of the Ceiling Act, does not indicate anything repugnant to the definition of ""person"" in the General Clauses Act , but merely adds ""joint family"" to the existing definition. Therefore the definition of person in the Ceiling Act, would include the definition of person in Section 3(35) of the General Clauses Act. The resultant position can be stated thus: the definition of person in the General Clauses Act , being an inclusive 35 definition, would include the ordinary, popular and general meaning and those specifically included in the definition. The inclusive definition of ""person"" in the Ceiling Act, in the absence of any exclusion, would have the same meaning assigned to the word in the General Clauses Act , and in addition, a ""joint family"" as defined. Thus, the word ""person"" in the Ceiling Act will, unless the context otherwise requires, refer to: (i) a natural human being; (ii) any legal entity which is capable of possessing rights and duties, including any company or association of persons or body of individuals (whether incorporated or not); and (iii) a Hindu Undivided Family or any other group or unit of persons, the members of which by custom or usage, are joint in estate and residence."" 30. In view of the above, the argument of the learned counsel that the word `person' in Section 154(1) means a human being or a natural person only and that the explanation by which a cooperative society was included in the said word is indicative of the legislature's intention to give a narrow meaning to the word `person' is liable to be rejected. In our view, the explanation instead of narrowing the meaning of the word `person' makes it clear that the same would include a non natural person. 31. The submission that if share of the individual Director is taken into consideration, the total land of the appellant would not exceed 12.50 acres is being mentioned only to be rejected in view of the contents of lease 36 agreement. That apart, no evidence was produced before the Collector or the Additional Commissioner to prove that the land was purchased in the name of the Directors of the appellant. Even before the learned Single Judge of the High Court and this Court, no such evidence has been produced. In Ramanlal Bhailal Patel 's case, this issue was considered and answered in negative in the following words: ""Instead of buying the land (172 acres 36 guntas) jointly under the four sale deeds it was open to the ten persons to have bought the lands individually, that is each of them purchasing such extent of land as he or she wanted. If they had registered the sale deeds individually (subject to each of them being entitled to buy agricultural land, under the land reforms laws in force) each couple would have been entitled to hold land to the extent of one unit. Instead of each individual or couple purchasing the land in their respective names, if for convenience in negotiations, ten individuals buy the land jointly, the position will be no different. It cannot be said that merely because the sale deed is in the joint names of ten persons, they purchased the land as ""an association of persons"" or as ""body of individuals"" with the common intention of carrying on agricultural activities jointly or producing income, profit or gain or carry on some common joint venture. In fact before purchasing the lands, the ten persons had entered into an agreement placing on record that the object of purchasing the lands jointly was only to facilitate negotiations and avoid duplicating the purchase procedures and not to cultivate them jointly. There is no evidence of any joint cultivation, nor any evidence of any intention to have a joint venture. On the other hand, after purchase, they divided the lands and informed the Land Revenue Authorities and each co-owner was registered as the owner of the respective land allotted to him/her. This is not a case where a body of individuals purchased the land with the intention of having a continued community of interest by way 37 of a joint venture or as a business venture. It is therefore not possible to treat the ten purchasers as an ""association of persons/body of individuals"" nor is it permissible to treat them as a single ""person"", thereby restricting their entitlement to hold land to only one unit, even though there are ten purchasers. The Tribunal and the High Court were right in holding that the word ""person"" in the Ceiling Act includes an ""association of persons/body of individuals"". But they were not justified in treating the co-owners as an ""association of persons"", or in holding that the ten co-owners will be entitled to own only one unit. Having regard to Section 6(2) of the Act, the share of each couple (husband and wife) in the land, plus any other land individually held by them will have to be calculated to find out whether they held any land in excess of the ceiling limit. Therefore, the share of each appellant in the lands jointly purchased, with the addition of the lands held by his spouse, and addition of any other land held by them, will give the basis for determining the surplus land. For example, if a husband's share as co-owner is 20 acres and wife's share as co-owner is 20 acres, and their other individual holding is another 10 acres (all of the same category in `C' Class), the total holding of the family will be 50 acres (20+20+10 acres) and the surplus will be 14 acres."" 32. The submission of Shri Manoj Swarup that a direction may be given to the State Government to accord post facto sanction to the purchase of excess land cannot be entertained much less accepted because the appellant has been found guilty of not coming to the Court with clean hands. In any case, in the absence of any factual foundation, such a plea cannot be entertained at this stage. 38 33. The appellant's grievance against the direction given by the learned Single Judge to the Chief Secretary to ensure that possession of excess land is taken without delay does not merit consideration because as mentioned in the earlier part of this judgment, the State Government had already granted lease of excess land to the appellant. 34. Before parting with the case, we deem it necessary to express our serious reservation about the bona fides of the State Government in granting lease of excess land to the appellant. It is impossible to fathom any rational reason for this action of the State Government ignoring that the appellant had purchased land in patent violation of Section 154(1) of the Act. By executing lease agreement dated 15.10.1994, the concerned officers of the State effectively frustrated the object sought to be achieved by the legislature by enacting the Act and the order passed by the Collector. 35. In the result, the appeal is dismissed. Since the appellant has not approached the quasi judicial and judicial forums i.e., the Additional Commissioner, the High Court and this Court with clean hands and succeeded in securing interim orders, it is ordained to pay costs, which is quantified at Rs.2 lacs. With a view to ensure that functionaries of the State 39 Government may not connive with the appellant and compound the wrong already done, we direct the Government of Uttar Pradesh not to renew the lease of the appellant at the end of 30 years period and deal with excess land in accordance with the provisions of the Act. .............................J.

"Mohan Mali & Anr vs State Of M.P on 28 April, 2010","1305","Mohan Mali & Anr. .. Appellants Vs. State of M.P. .. Respondent O R D E R ALTAMAS KABIR, J. 1. This Appeal, which arises out of Special Leave Petition (Crl.) No.6276 of 2007, is directed against the judgment and order of the Indore Bench of the Madhya Pradesh High Court in Criminal Appeal No.898 of 1997, challenging the judgment and order 2 of conviction passed by the Addl. Sessions Judge, Dhar, in Sessions Trial No.366 of 1994. By virtue of the said judgment, the Appellants, along with two other co-accused, were convicted under Sections 302 / 34 , 326 / 34 and 324 / 34 of Indian Penal Code and sentenced to life imprisonment along with fine of Rs.5,000/- for the offence under Section 302 / 34 IPC, three years' rigorous imprisonment along with fine of Rs.500/- for the offence under Section 326 / 34 IPC and one year's rigorous imprisonment along with fine of Rs.500/- for the offence under Section 324 / 34 IPC along with further sentence in default of payment of fine. It may be mentioned that the Special Leave Petition filed by one of the other co-accused, Bhagwan, being S.L.P.(Crl.) No.540 of 2008, was rejected on 16th April, 2008, when notice was issued on S.L.P.(Crl.) No.6276 of 2007. 3 2. On 17th July, 2009, when the Special Leave Petition came up for admission, leave was granted and the hearing of the appeal was expedited. However, the Appellants' prayer for bail was rejected at that stage. When the matter was being heard for grant of leave, a plea of juvenility was made on behalf of Appellant No.2, Dhanna Lal, and this Court observed that in the event Dhanna Lal was able to provide proof of his claim that he was a juvenile on the date of the incident, he would be at liberty to apply afresh for grant of bail with such supporting evidence. Pursuant thereto, a fresh bail application was filed on behalf of Dhanna Lal on 27th January, 2010, annexing a copy of the Birth Certificate of Dhanna Lal issued by the Chief Registrar (Birth and Death), Municipal Corporation, Dhar, under Section 12 of the Birth and Death Registration Act, 1969, maintained by the Corporation. From the said certificate it appears 4 that Dhanna Lal's date of birth was recorded as 12th November, 1976 and was registered on 17th November, 1976, making it a document which was contemporaneous with his birth. Upon due verification, it was confirmed on behalf of the State of Madhya Pradesh that the Appellant No.2, Dhanna Lal, was a juvenile on the date of commission of the offence. Appearing for the State, Mr. Pramod Swarup, Senior Advocate, very fairly submitted that Dhanna Lal was, therefore, entitled to the benefit of Section 7A read with Section 64 of the Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act, 2000, hereinafter referred to as `the 2000 Act'. 3. Mr. S.K. Dubey, learned senior counsel appearing for the Appellants, submitted that the Appellant No.2, Dhanna Lal, although a minor, within the meaning of the 2000 Act, had not only been tried along with other co-accused, who were 5 not juveniles, in violation of Section 18 of the 2000 Act, but had also undergone 9 years of imprisonment, despite a maximum sentence of three years which could have been imposed on him under Section 15 of the 2000 Act. 4. Among other questions, this question also fell for determination of this Court in the case of Hari Ram vs. State of Rajasthan & Anr. [(2009) 13 SCC 211]. This Court while considering the various provisions of the 2000 Act, as amended in 2006, and, in particular, Section 7A which was introduced in the parent Act by the amending Act of 2006, held that Section 7A would have to be read in tandem with Section 20 of the 2000 Act and Rule 98 of the Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Rules, 2007, hereinafter referred to as `the 2007 Rules', which deal with disposed of cases of juveniles in conflict with law. Since all the three provisions are of relevance to this Appeal, 6 the same are being separately dealt with hereinbelow. 5. Section 7A of the 2000 Act, which provides the procedure to be followed when claim of juvenility is raised before any Court, reads as follows :- ""7A. Procedure to be followed when claim of juvenility is raised before any court.- (1) Whenever a claim of juvenility is raised before any court or a court is of the opinion that an accused person was a juvenile on the date of commission of the offence, the court shall make an inquiry, take such evidence as may be necessary (but not an affidavit) so as to determine the age of such person, and shall record a finding whether the person is a juvenile or a child or not, stating his age as nearly as may be: Provided that a claim of juvenility may be raised before any court and it shall be recognised at any stage, even after final disposal of the case, and such claim shall be determined in terms of the provisions contained in this Act and the rules made thereunder, even if the juvenile has ceased to be so on or before the date of commencement of this Act. (2) If the court finds a person to be a juvenile on the date of commission of the 7 offence under Sub-section (1), it shall forward the juvenile to the Board for passing appropriate order, and the sentence if any, passed by a court shall be deemed to have no effect."" What is of relevance is the fact that Section 7A of the 2000 Act allows a claim of juvenility to be raised before any Court at any stage even after final disposal of the case and speaks of the procedure which the Court is required to adopt when such claim of juvenility is raised. 6. Section 20 of the 2000 Act specially provides for the procedure to be followed in pending cases and reads as follows :- ""20. Special provision in respect of pending cases.- Notwithstanding anything contained in this Act, all proceedings in respect of a juvenile pending in any court in any area on the date on which this Act comes into force in that area, shall be continued in that court as if this Act had not been passed and if the court finds that the juvenile has committed an offence, it shall record such finding and instead of passing any sentence in respect 8 of the juvenile, forward the juvenile to the Board which shall pass orders in respect of that juvenile in accordance with the provisions of this Act as if it had been satisfied on inquiry under this Act that a juvenile has committed the offence. [Provided that the Board may, for any adequate and special reason to be mentioned in the order, review the case and pass appropriate order in the interest of such juvenile. Explanation.- In all pending cases including trial, revision, appeal or any other criminal proceedings in respect of a juvenile in conflict with law, in any court, the determination of juvenility of such a juvenile shall be in terms of Clause (1) of Section 2 , even if the juvenile ceases to be so on or before the date of commencement of this Act and the provisions of this Act shall apply as if the said provisions had been in force, for all purposes and at all material times when the alleged offence was committed.]"" What is to be noticed in the aforesaid Section is that it makes provision for continuance of trials which had been commenced prior to the coming into operation of the 2000 Act. While providing that the trial could continue before the Court, if 9 it was found that the juvenile had committed an offence, the Court would be required to record such finding and instead of passing any sentence in respect of the juvenile, forward the juvenile to the Juvenile Justice Board, which could then pass orders in respect of that juvenile in accordance with the provisions of the 2000 Act. 7. Section 64 of the 2000 Act deals with a situation where a juvenile in conflict with law is already undergoing sentence at the commencement of the Act, and the same reads as follows :- ""64. Juvenile in conflict with law undergoing sentence at commencement of this Act.-In any area in which this Act is brought into force, the State Government shall direct that a juvenile in conflict with law who is undergoing any sentence of imprisonment at the commencement of this Act, shall, in lieu of undergoing such sentence, be sent to a special home or be kept in fit institution in such manner as the State Government thinks fit for the remainder of the period of the sentence; and the provisions of this Act shall apply to the juvenile as if he had been ordered 1 by the Board to be sent to such special home or institution or, as the case may be, ordered to be kept under protective care under sub-section (2) of section 16 of this Act."" The said provision has to be read along with Sections 7A and 20 of the 2000 Act, together with Rule 98 of the 2007 Rules, which deals with disposed of cases of juveniles in conflict with law, and provides as follows: ""98. Disposed of cases of juveniles in conflict with law. - The State Government or as the case may be the Board may, either suo motu or on an application made for the purpose, review the case of a person or a juvenile in conflict with law, determine his juvenility in terms of the provisions contained in the Act and Rule 12 of these rules and pass an appropriate order in the interest of the juvenile in conflict with law under Section 64 of the Act, for the immediate release of the juvenile in conflict with law whose period of detention or imprisonment has exceeded the maximum period provided in Section 15 of the said Act."" 1 8. In the facts of this case, we are faced with a situation where the juvenile, Dhanna Lal, had already been tried along with adults and had been convicted under Sections 302 / 34 , 326 / 34 and 324 / 34 IPC and was sentenced to life imprisonment, out of which he has already undergone about 9 years of the sentence. Rule 98 of the 2007 Rules, in our view, squarely applies to Appellant No.2 Dhanna Lal's case. His case is to be considered not only for grant of bail, but also for release in terms of the said Rule, since he has completed more than the maximum period of sentence as provided under Section 15 of the 2000 Act. 9. The legal position has been clearly explained in Hari Ram 's case (supra) and does not, therefore, require any further elucidation in this case. 10. Having regard to the fact that the Appellant No.2, Dhanna Lal, was a minor on the date of 1 commission of the offence, and has already undergone more than the maximum sentence provided under Section 15 of the 2000 Act, by applying the provisions of Rule 98 of the 2007 Rules read with Sections 15 and 64 of the 2000 Act, we allow the appeal as far as he is concerned and direct that he be released forthwith. The bail application filed on his behalf is also disposed of, accordingly. 11. Let the appeal, as far as the other accused, Mohan Mali, is concerned, be listed for hearing separately. ________________J. (ALTAMAS KABIR) ________________J.

These appeals are directed against the orders of interlocutory nature passed by the Special Court constituted 2 under the provisions of the Special Courts (Trial of Offences Relating to Transactions in Securities) Act, 1992 (hereinafter referred to as `the Act'). They are being disposed of by this common order since the question that arises for our consideration is one and the same. 2. M/s. Dhanraj Mills Private Limited in its ordinary course of business had advanced interest free loans to the appellant M/s. Killick Nixon Limited and its group of companies. In the year 1992, the Special Court found that M/s. Dhanraj Mills Private Limited, its Directors and their close associates indulged in fraudulent securities transactions resulting in siphoning of huge funds of various banks. The banks had gone into liquidation as a result of those fraudulent securities transactions. The Special Court also held that the end beneficiaries of the siphoned funds were the Directors of M/s. Dhanraj Mills Private Limited and Director of Bank of Karad which bank was used as a conduit for the fraudulent transactions. 3. M/s. Dhanraj Mills Private Limited was accordingly notified under the provisions of the said Act. On and from the date of notification, the properties, movable or immovable, or both belonging to any person notified under sub-section (2) of Section 3 of the said Act shall stand attached, simultaneously with the issue of the notification. Be it noted that M/s. Dhanraj Mills Private Limited itself owned 33% of M/s. Killick 3 Nixon Limited and the person in ultimate control, ownership and management of M/s. Killick Nixon Limited is one T.B. Ruia (who at all relevant points of time was Managing Director of M/s. Dhanraj Mills Private Limited) who was also notified under the Act. 4. The Custodian, on behalf of M/s Dhanraj Mills Private Limited, proceeded against the appellant M/s. Killick Nixon Ltd. and its group Companies for recovery of loans totaling Rs.20,81,67,031/-. The amounts due to M/s. Dhanraj Mills Private Limited also stood attached with the issue of notification. 5. In the year 1995, the appellant M/s. Killick Nixon Limited and its group Companies filed separate applications before Special Court for ascertaining their individual liabilities with a request to grant time for recompense. Simultaneously, the Custodian also filed applications for fixation of liability and demanding interest @ 24% per annum. In the year 1997, the Special Court passed decrees against the appellant and its group Companies which are consent decrees qua invitum the Custodian, whereby individually ascertained amounts were to be paid in installments with the interest @ 15% per annum. Similar consent decree was passed against 13th group Company also. 6. M/s Dhanraj Mills Private Limited, in the meanwhile, made an application before the Special Judge 4 contending that the amounts recovered from the group Companies cannot be attached towards the debt payable by M/s Dhanraj Mills Private Limited to the Custodian, since there was no nexus between loans advanced to original judgment-debtors and the transactions with the banks. The prayer in the said application was that the amount so recovered was to be freed from attachment until to be paid back to M/s Dhanraj Mills Private Limited, by the Custodian. The Special Court dismissed the claim so made on the ground that the Directors of M/s Dhanraj Mills Private Limited and its close associates were involved in fraudulent deals and have siphoned off funds belonging to banks. The Special Court found overwhelming evidence that M/s Dhanraj Mills Private Limited is liable to make payment and all its assets fall within the purview of the Act. It is in this order the Special Court specifically held that this is a fit case ""for the corporate veil to be torn off"" as M/s Dhanraj Mills Private Limited had no explanation whatsoever for how such large amounts of ""loans"" could have been advanced to the appellant and its group Companies when M/s Dhanraj Mills Private Limited itself had been defunct for many years without any commercial activity of its own. 7. In the year 1999, The Special Court having considered the request of the original judgment debtors, granted extension of time and directed the Custodian not to proceed with execution of the decrees, subject to payment of defaulted 5 installments. As usually, the appellant and its group Companies defaulted in payment of the said amounts once again. Left with no alternative, the Custodian filed execution applications against the judgment debtors for recovery of dues from M/s Dhanraj Mills Private Limited. It is not necessary to refer the facts, the subsequent events in detail and various objections raised from time to time as to the sale of properties in the process of realizing the decretal amounts. However, one important fact that may be required to state is that the Special Court by its earlier order dated 30th November, 2001 required the judgment debtors to pay Rs.16 crores payable towards all decrees for considering the prayer for extension of time to which all of them agreed to do so. This singular fact establishes that even judgment debtors were treating the separate decrees passed against each one of them as a consolidated common decree. The Custodian, at all points of time treated them as a group to which no objections were raised at any point of time. The sale proceeds were accordingly appropriated against dues of the entire group of M/s Killick Nixon Ltd. 8. The dispute now raised by the appellants is that the sale proceeds or the properties of M/s. Killick Nixon group companies ought to be apportioned individually decree wise. This is contrary to its earlier stand. The material available on record also reveals that these group companies have always 6 referred to the aggregate principal amount of alleged loan given by M/s. Dhanraj Mills Private Limited. 9. The appellants submitted before the Special Court that the liabilities of the judgment debtors under separate decrees were not joint liabilities inasmuch as each judgment debtor is a separate entity in law having their separate properties and assets. It was the case of the appellants that merely because the judgment debtors are group companies the amount of decree passed against them cannot be consolidated. It was their case that the Custodian cannot be permitted to appropriate the amounts paid by the judgment debtors as also the sale proceeds realized from the sale of properties towards a consolidated decree. It is not necessary to refer in detail the stand taken by the Custodian opposing the plea of the appellants. Various instances were pointed out by the Custodian as to how the appellants themselves were treating the decrees as a consolidated one. 10. It was specifically demonstrated by the Custodian that the appellants not only treated them as one group but have themselves proceeded and agreed to have appropriation of the sale proceeds of the properties sold on group basis. The averment in the petition filed in the Special Court contained figures relating to the aggregate dues of the group, the aggregate amounts received from the sale of properties and the aggregate balance amount. 7 11. The Special Court after a detailed consideration came to the conclusion that M/s. Killick Nixon Limited and others are group companies and they are all controlled by M/s. Dhanraj Mills Private Limited - notified party and the amounts that are being recovered in execution of the decrees are really public funds which were siphoned off by the Directors of M/s Dhanraj Mills Private Limited, and parked in the companies controlled by them. The Special Court accordingly held that the appropriation of sale proceeds made by the Custodian is proper and accordingly the Custodian should proceed further to recover the amount that remained in balance. 12. In these appeals, the singular submission made by Shri Dhruv Mehta, learned senior counsel for the appellants, is that the appropriation of sale proceeds ought to have been carried out individually against each of the decree and not as done by the Custodian treating all the decrees as a consolidated decree. 13. Having heard learned counsel for the appellants and respondent, we are satisfied that an interference with the impugned order passed by the Special Court, which is purely interlocutory and does not decide any rights of any party, is unwarranted. The Special Court did not decide any rights of the parties but merely passed orders from time to time including the one under the appeals for the realization of the amounts under the decrees passed which attained their finality. The procedure adopted for realization of the amounts under the decrees and the 8 manner of appropriation, in our considered opinion, by itself does not amount to deciding any lis as such between the parties. Under Section 10 of the Act that an appeal shall lie to this Court from any judgment, sentence or order of the Special Court but not against the interlocutory orders. Appeals against interlocutory orders are specially excluded under the said provision. 14. There cannot be any iota of doubt that M/s Killick Nixon and other companies were always treated as one group and there is a clear finding in this regard by the Special Court that the said group of companies are nothing but front companies of M/s. Dhanraj Mills Private Limited. 15. The orders impugned in these appeals are purely interlocutory in nature against which no appeal lies to this court under Section 10 of the Act. We are fortified in that view of ours by a decision of this court in CIFCO Properties (P) Ltd. and Others vs. Custodian and Others1 . Even on merits, we find that the Special Court having meticulously analyzed the facts, arrived at a proper conclusion and rightly treated the decrees as a consolidated one. 16. We find no merit in these appeals and they are accordingly dismissed without any order as to costs. --------------------------J. 1 [ (2005) 3 SCC 708 ] 9 [B.SUDERSHAN REDDY] --------------------------J.

Panchal , Harjit Singh Bedi CA No. 1920 of 2009 1 IN THE SUPREME COURT OF INDIA CIVIL APPELLATE JURISDICTION CIVIL APPEAL NO. 1920 OF 2009 ANIMESH RANJAN & ORS. ..... APPELLANT VERSUS RAI CHANDI NATH SAHAY & ANR. ..... RESPONDENT WITH CIVIL APPEAL NO. OF 2010 ARISING OUT OF SLP(c) No. 36252 of 2009 O R D E R 1. Leave granted in SLP(C) 36252 of 2009. 2. We have heard the learned counsel for the parties at length. 3. In the light of the fact that the appellants herein had been granted Probate of the Will dated 3rd January, 1983 and the rival Will set up by the respondents has been ignored, we find no balance of convenience in favour of the respondent. Certain legal issues have been raised with regard to the right of the appellants to alienate the property in contravention of the specific bar imposed by CA No. 1920 of 2009 2 the Will but we find that this matter will have to await a decision in the suit which is pending before the trial court. However, keeping in view the facts of the case and to balance the equities on both sides it is appropriate that as the appellants have not been able to act upon the Will for almost 27 years, we direct that the appellants be permitted to complete the building in question. 4. Mr. Shyam Diwan, the learned senior counsel for the appellant, further informs us that 32 flats in all have been carved out in the building for sale and whereas 19 have been agreed to be sold, the balance 13 flats will be completed but will not be sold or any agreement to sell executed in respect of these till further orders. Mr. Diwan further states that in case sale deeds are executed with respect to those 19 flats a clause in the sale deed would be incorporated highlighting that the matter was subjudice and the parties would be bound by the outcome of the proceedings in the civil suit. 5. In the light of the fact that the matter has been pending since long in one forum or the other, we direct the trial court to take a decision in the suit within a period of six months from today and in case it finds that either one or the other party is procrastinating in the CA No. 1920 of 2009 3 disposal of the suit the trial court will ensure a speedy trial, by resorting to the legal provisions available in the Code of Civil Procedure . CA NO. 3654 of 2010 @ SLP(C) No. 36252 of 2009 6. The order of the High Court shall be substituted by our order in C.A. No.1920 of 2009.

Lodha , Aftab Alam NON-REPORTABLE IN THE SUPREME COURT OF INDIA CIVIL APPELLATE JURISDICTION CIVIL APPEAL NO. 2315 OF 2003 Sri Srinivasa Bhat (D) by L.Rs. & Ors. ...Appellants Versus Sri A. Sarvothama Kini (D) by L.Rs. & Ors. ...Respondents JUDGEMENT R.M. Lodha, J. This appeal, by special leave, is from Karnataka High Court. The Division Bench vide its order dated November 21, 2001 set aside the order of the Single Judge dated June 1, 2001 and also the order of the Land Tribunal dated March 29, 1994 and directed the Land Tribunal to pass fresh order concerning the subject land. 2. On March 29, 1994, the appellants were conferred occupancy rights by the Land Tribunal in respect of Survey No. 108/17 (delineated as R.S. No. 108/17 C) admeasuring 27 cents situate at Shivalli village, Udupi Taluk, Karnataka. The controversy relates to the aforesaid land to the extent of 7 cents. The present respondent nos. 1 to 5 (hereinafter referred to as `writ petitioners') filed a writ petition before Karnataka High Court on January 4, 1999 challenging the order of Land Tribunal dated March 29, 1994. The writ petitioners set up the case that the extent of property admeasuring 7 cents being the portion of Survey No. 108/17 originally belonged to one Sri Krishna Kini who transferred the said land to Sri Rangannaiah (father of 5th writ petitioner) in 1949 and the purchaser came into possession. Sri Rangannaiah mainly used the said land for non-residential purposes as the property is situate in the heart of Udupi city in a prime business locality and no agricultural operations were ever carried out in the said land by Sri Rangannaiah. After the death of Sri Rangannaiah, the said land came to the share of 5th writ petitioner who transferred it to writ petitioner nos. 1 to 4 and they came in actual possession and enjoyment of the same. It was averred that in the beginning of 1998, Smt. Krishnaveniamma (Appellant No. 2 herein) tried to interfere with their possession and hence a suit (O.S. No. 74/1998) was filed by them in the Court of IInd Additional Civil 2 Judge (Jr. Division), Udupi wherein it transpired that the present appellants were asserting their rights in the said land on the basis of occupancy rights conferred upon them by the Land Tribunal. The writ petitioner nos. 1 to 4 then made enquiries from the Land Tribunal, got the copy of the order dated March 29, 1994 and approached the High Court. 3. The present appellants who were respondents in the writ petition filed their reply and raised diverse objections viz; that the writ petitioners have no locus standi to maintain the writ petition as they were not parties to the proceedings before the Land Tribunal; that the challenge to the order dated March 29, 1994 passed by the Land Tribunal suffered from delay and laches; that the writ petitioners concealed material facts with regard to rejection of their prayer for temporary injunction in the suit filed by them; and that in the suit, for consideration of the application for temporary injunction, the court appointed Assistant Director of Land Records as Commissioner, who after factual assessment of the subject land submitted a sketch stating therein that the claim of the writ petitioners was not correct and they were not in possession and that they have no right or interest in the subject land. 3 4. The Single Judge, after hearing the parties and on consideration of the material placed on record, held that the writ petitioners were not able to show that they have any interest in the land in respect of which occupancy rights have been conferred in favour of the present appellants. The Single Judge also observed that the writ petitioners did not disclose the complete facts about the suit and approached the court in challenging the order dated March 29, 1994 belatedly and, accordingly, dismissed the writ petition by his order dated June 1, 2001. 5. As noticed above, the Division Bench in writ appeal interfered with the order of the Single Judge giving rise to this appeal by special leave. 6. We find it curious that the Division Bench though recorded the finding that writ petition was hopelessly belated and there were other factors which would disentitle the writ petitioners from any relief, yet it interfered with the order of the Single Judge. What is more astonishing is that the Division Bench even did not consider the findings recorded by the Single Judge, particularly that for want of documentary evidence, the version of the writ petitioner nos. 1 to 4 that the 4 said land has been conveyed to them by 5th writ petitioner and they were in possession of that land cannot be believed. As a matter of fact, the Single Judge recorded a positive finding that the material produced by the writ petitioners do not show that they have got any right or interest in Survey No. 108/17 to the extent of 7 cents and, accordingly, they cannot be said to have any locus standi to challenge the order dated March 29, 1994 passed by the Land Tribunal. On the face of the findings recorded by the Single Judge which have not been disturbed, there was no justification for the Division Bench to hold that the overwhelming interest of justice would require that writ petitioners be afforded an opportunity and thereby upset the order of the Single Judge as well as that of the Land Tribunal. The Division Bench without consideration of the reasons recorded by the Single Judge interfered with that order which, in our opinion, cannot be justified. 7. Moreover, the writ petitioners concealed vital facts from the Court viz., rejection of their application for temporary injunction by the trial court and the appointment of Court Commissioner by the trial court and his report. The report submitted by the Assistant Director of Land Records (Court 5 Commissioner) did not support the claim of writ petitioner nos. 1 to 4 in respect of 7 cents of land in Survey No.108/17. The remedy under Article 226 of the Constitution is discretionary and relief may be refused if it is found that the party invoking such jurisdiction has not disclosed true, correct and complete facts. Relief may also be refused in extraordinary jurisdiction where writ petition suffers from laches and unexplained delay. Insofar as instant case is concerned, the order of the Land Tribunal dated March 29, 1994 was challenged in the writ petition almost after five years. The explanation of writ petitioner nos. 1 to 4 that they came to know of that order in 1998 hardly merits acceptance as it transpires that in 1994 itself they made an application before the Tahsildar for effecting changes in the mutation and other revenue record contending that they have interest in 7 cents of land in Survey No. 108/17C and after inquiry, the Tahsildar rejected their application. The writ petitioners are guilty of suppression of material facts as well. In the circumstances, there was hardly any justification for the Division Bench to interfere with the discretion exercised by the Single Judge. 6 8. There is one more illegality in the order of the Division Bench. Although, the writ petitioner nos. 1 to 4 claimed their right to the extent of 7 cents only in Survey No. 108/17 but the Division Bench set aside the entire order of the Land Tribunal dated March 29, 1994 that pertained to 27 cents of land. Admittedly, the writ petitioners did not claim any right or interest beyond 7 cents. 9. The result is, that appeal is allowed and impugned order dated November 21, 2001 passed by the Division Bench in writ appeal No. 3473 of 2001 is set aside. No order as to costs. ..................... ...J (Aftab Alam) ........................J (R. M. Lodha) New Delhi April 27, 2010. 7"

Supreme Court of India Mohan Kumar Rayana vs Komal Mohan Rayana on 6 April, 2010 Author: Altamas Kabir Bench: Altamas Kabir , G.S. Singhvi , Cyriac Joseph MOHAN KUMAR RAYANA v. KOMAL MOHAN RAYANA (SLP(Civil) No. 9821-9822 of 2009) APRIL 6, 2010 [Altamas Kabir, G.S. Singhvi and Cyriac Joseph, JJ.] 2010 (4) SCR 402 The Judgment of the Court was delivered by ALTAMAS KABIR, J. 1. These petitions involve the final stage of a custody battle on account of disruption and finally a break down of the marriage ties between the petitioner and the respondent. 2. The petitioner and the respondent got married in Hyderabad on 11th August, 2000. A girl child, Anisha, was born on 2nd March, 2002. The nuclear family, along with the mother of the petitioner-husband, resided together at Chamboor, Mumbai till July, 2004 when, for whatever reason, the respondent-wife left the matrimonial home to stay with her parents at Bandra. On 24th November, 2005, with the help of police personnel from Chamboor Police Station, she took away Anisha from the custody of the petitioner's mother. The petitioner recovered the custody of the daughter on 30th November, 2005 and this resulted in both the husband as well as the wife filing separate Custody Petitions before the Family Court in December, 2005. On 20th December, 2005, the Family Court granted weekend access/visitation right to the respondent-wife and by a subsequent order dated 15th September, 2006. the Family Court granted interim custody of the child to the petitioner-husband pending hearing and final disposal of the Custody Petition. The child remained in custody of the petitioner-father between November, 2005 and 2nd February, 2007, when the husband was directed to make over the custody of the child to the respondent-wife and since then she has been in the custody of the respondent-wife. 3. Two appeals being Family Court Appeal No.29 of 2007 and Family Court Appeal No.61 of 2007 were filed by the petitioner-husband and the respondent-wife respectively. The Family Court Appeal No.29 of 2007, which was filed by the petitioner-husband, was directed against the judgment and order of the Family Court directing that custody of the minor child be made over to the respondent-wife. Despite the finding that during the period when Anisha was in the petitioner's custody she had been well looked after and cared for and the petitioner had dutifully discharged his parental responsibility towards her. In the other appeal, the respondent-wife challenged the order of access made in favour of the petitioner-husband on every alternate weekend and to share 50% of the School Vacations with the petitioner. In fact, at one stage this matter also once appeared before us and certain specific directions were given regarding the manner of access of the petitioner-husband to Anisha. While disposing of the pending appeals, the Division Bench of the High Court had occasion to consider the legal and practical approach regarding custody of the minor in the light of the well-established doctrine that in these cases, the welfare and interest of the minor was the paramount consideration. Having dealt with the relevant provisions of the Hindu Minority and Guardianship Act, 1956 , since the parents as also the minor is a Hindu and while passing the final order the Division Bench was fully alive to the fact that under Section 6 of the above Act the father is the natural guardian of the person of the minor during his minority. Despite the said legal position, the High Court, after carefully considering the various other aspects conducive to the child's welfare, and despite the interim order of custody in favour of the petitioner-husband, chose not to interfere with the order of the Family Court and directed that the custody of minor Anisha should continue to be with her mother, the respondent herein, and that sufficient access provided to the petitioner-father would meet the ends of justice. The petitioner's prayer for Anisha's custody, therefore, was rejected and being aggrieved thereby, the petitioner-husband has filed the instant Special Leave Petition. 4. On behalf of the petitioner-husband it was urged that the judgment and order of the High Court suffered from various infirmities. It was submitted that having found that Anisha had been well looked after during the period of petitioner's custody and the respondent-wife was trying to poison the child's mind against the petitioner and having also held that from the psychiatric evaluation made that the respondent-wife had a manipulative personality, apart from having a tendency towards psychosis which needed medical attention, the High Court erroneously chose note to interfere with the order of the Family Court directing custody of minor Anisha to be made over to the respondent-wife. It was further urged that the High Court had not properly appreciated the fact that when the respondent-wife left the matrimonial home in July, 2004 to pursue film and television career, she left Anisha behind when she was only 2 years and 4 months old, thereby virtually abandoning the child when she needed her mother's care the most. For more than 2 years she did not have any contact with Anisha till in May, 2005 she forcibly removed Anisha from her paternal grandmother's custody. It was submitted that the respondent-wife was so bent upon pursuing a career in films and television that she had no qualms about leaving a 2= year old baby girl who needed her attention and motherly affection. 5. Mr. Shyam Divan, learned Senior Advocate, who appeared with Dr. A.M. Singhvi, learned Senior Advocate, for the appellant, submitted that the final conclusion of the judgment and order of the High Court was against the grain of the findings therein regarding the petitioner's ability to look after the welfare of the minor child. Mr. Divan urged that both the parties were subjected to psychiatric evaluation on the directions of the High Court and in all the reports, and, in particular, in the report dated 20th September, 2007, submitted by Dr. Haridas, who was the Head of Department of Psychiatry, JJ Hospital, Mumbai, the respondent was diagnosed with a histrionic personality disorder of a nature that rendered her unfit for having custody of the child. It was pointed out that in the said report it was also mentioned that the respondent-wife was highly manipulative and readily spoke lies even for trivial matters and showed trends of psychosis. On a comparative assessment of both the parties, the report concluded that it would not be in the interest of the child to keep her in the custody of respondent-mother and that, on the contrary, the petitioner-father was more fit and capable to undertake the upbringing of the child. Mr. Divan submitted that even in the second report submitted on 22nd November, 2008, it was stated that there was no evidence to revise the recommendations made in the earlier report. Mr. Divan submitted that despite the opinion of the medical experts and the Court's own findings that the child was being manipulated, tutored and poisoned against the petitioner-husband by the respondent-wife, the High Court, as mentioned earlier, had erroneously chosen not to interfere with the order of the Family Court and in the ultimate analysis allowed the custody of the minor child to remain with the respondent-wife. 6. It was also submitted that in the face of the opinion of experts, the Family Court ought not to have relied upon the statements made by the Counsellors appointed by it or on the evidence of Shridhar Khochare, the Secretary of the Society where the parents of the respondent resided, or the evidence of Dr. Vivek Hebar who had also seen the respondent-wife at the school where Anisha was studying. It was submitted that as against the opinion of Dr. Anjali Chhabaria, wherein it was clearly stated that Anisha had confided in her that the respondent was mad and was not good, the Family Court ought not to have given undue importance to the report of Mrs. A.R. Tulalwar who had interviewed Anisha on 13th January, 2006. It was also submitted that the attitude of the respondent-wife to block all interaction between the petitioner and the child in order to alienate the child completely from the petitioner and to deprive her of the petitioner's love and affection as a father, was also a factor which went against the respondent being given custody of the minor. Mr. Divan submitted that obsession of the respondent- wife for exclusive custody of the minor child was commented upon by the High Court and the very fact that she has also filed an appeal only with regard to 50% access given to the petitioner-husband during the minor's school vacations, also made her obsession for exclusive custody, to the detriment of the child's interest, very clear. It was submitted that a parent who poisons the child's mind against her father does not act in the child's welfare and should not, therefore, be entrusted with the custody of the child. Mr. Divan submitted that the minor child requires love and care of both the parents and even if the relationship between the two are disrupted, the child should not be deprived of a meaningful relationship with both the parents. It was urged that while the wishes of the minor are to be considered seriously in deciding a matter of custody, the same was not the sole criteria and it would have to be seen as to who would be more suitable for the upbringing of the child, who, till November, 2005, when the child was about 3= years' old, did not even make an attempt to meet the child and was prepared to sacrifice the welfare of the child in order to pursue a film and television career. Mr. Divan submitted that in view of the conduct of the respondent and her denial of access to the minor despite the orders of this Court, the respondent should not be allowed to enjoy the fruits of her conduct. 7. In this regard, Mr. Divan referred to the decision of this Court in Gaurav Nagpal vs. Sumedha Nagpal [(2009) 1 SCC 42], wherein this Court, inter alia, held that the paramount consideration of the Court in determining the question as to who should be given the custody of a minor child, is the ""welfare of the child"" and not rights of the parents under the statute for the time being in force or what the parties say. The Court has to give due weightage to the child's ordinary contentment, health, education, intellectual development and favourable surroundings, but over and above physical comforts, the moral and ethical values should also be noted. They are equal, if not more important than the other. When the Court is confronted with conflicting statements made by the parents, each time it has to justify the demands and has not only to look at the issue on a legalistic basis but human angles are also to be considered as relevant for deciding the issues. In the facts of the said case where the father had flouted the orders of the Court in keeping the custody of the minor child with him, this Court observed that he cannot be a beneficiary of his own wrongs and the said fact cannot be ignored while considering the father's claim that the child had not been living with him since a long time. It was also observed that in child custody matters there should be a proper balance between the rights of the parents and the welfare of the child and in such circumstances, the choice of the minor is also an important consideration. Mr. Divan submitted that in the face of overwhelming evidence that the respondent should not be entrusted with the custody of the minor child, both the Family Court as well as the High Court quite inexplicably decided that the interest of the minor would be best served if custody was given to the respondent. It was submitted that if the welfare and future interest of the minor was to be taken into consideration, the order of the Family Court as affirmed by the High Court, was liable to be set aside and the custody of the minor child should be made over to the petitioner. 8. The submissions made by Mr. Shyam Divan were firmly opposed by Ms. Meenakshi Lekhi, learned Advocate, who appeared for the respondent- wife. Learned counsel submitted that the allegation that the respondent-wife had abandoned her minor child was incorrect, since in March, 2005, when she left her matrimonial home, she took Anisha with her in terms of an arrangement between the petitioner and herself. Ms. Lekhi submitted that this aspect of the matter had been examined at some length by the learned Judge, Family Court, Mumbai at Bandra in his judgment dated 2nd February, 2007 and the allegation of the petitioner-husband that there was no communication between the respondent and the minor daughter stood contradicted by the evidence on record. In fact, the learned Judge, Family Court had gone on to observe that the contrary stand taken by the petitioner- husband and the positive statement brought out in his cross-examination was sufficient to dislodge his case that the respondent-wife had abandoned the child. 9. Ms. Lekhi also submitted that Mrs. A.R. Tulalwar, Marriage Counsellor appointed by the Principal Judge, Family Court, to ascertain the wishes of the minor child for the purpose of access by the respondent-wife, had in her final report indicated that the child shared a normal relationship with the respondent-wife and considering her age she needed her mother's company to strengthen the bond between them. It was also observed that the child was familiar with the mother and access would have to be worked out even outside the Court. In her second interview report, Mrs. Tulalwar further observed that Anisha share a very good relationship with her mother and was willing to spend time with her mother, and, in fact, this was her need at her age. Ms. Lekhi also referred to the interview which the Court had had with the child on 15th November, 2006, whereupon the Court concluded that as far as the wishes of the child were concerned, she did not want to leave her father as well as her mother, as she loved both of them very dearly and wanted them to reunite. 10. Ms. Lekhi submitted that the allegations regarding abandonment of the child by the respondent-wife were not, therefore, believed by the learned Principal Judge, Family Court, which ultimately felt that it would be in the best interest of the minor if her custody was made over to the respondent-wife. 11. As far as the allegations regarding denial of access by the respondent-wife to the petitioner to meet Anisha is concerned, it was urged that between 2007 till January, 2009, the petitioner made no attempt to exercise visitation rights given to him and did not make any attempt to meet the child. On the other hand, the petitioner who is very successful businessman and who has to go abroad very often, was not really interested in the welfare of the child since a suggestion had also been made by Dr. Haridas that if the petitioner-husband was not willing to accept custody of the child, she could always be sent to a boarding school. 12. Ms. Lekhi submitted that the order passed by the learned Principal Judge, Family Court, Mumbai at Bandra, as affirmed by the High Court, did not warrant any interference and the Special Leave Petitions were liable to be dismissed. 13. Having the interest of the minor in mind, we decided to meet her separately in order to make an assessment of her behavioural pattern towards both the petitioner as well as the respondent. Much against the submissions which have been made during the course of hearing of the matter, Anisha appeared to have no inhibitions in meeting the petitioner- father with whom she appeared to have an excellent understanding. There was no evidence of Anisha being hostile to her father when they met each other in our presence. From the various questions which we put to Anisha, who, in our view, is an extremely intelligent and precocious child, she wanted to enjoy the love and affection both of her father as well as her mother and even in our presence expressed the desire that what she wanted most was that they should come together again. However, Anisha seems to prefer her mother's company as the bonding between them is greater than the bonding with her father. Anisha is a happy child, the way she is now and having regard to her age and the fact that she is a girl child, we are of the view that she requires her mother's company more at this stage of her life. There is no doubt that the petitioner is very fond of Anisha and is very concerned about her welfare and future, but in view of his business commitments it would not be right or even practicable to disturb the status quo prevailing with regard to Anisha's custody. The conditions laid down by the High Court regarding visitation rights to the petitioner are, in our view, sufficient for Anisha to experience the love and affection both of her father and mother. There is no reason why the petitioner, who will have access to Anisha on holidays and weekends, cannot look after her welfare without having continuous custody of her person. As has repeatedly been said, in these matters the interest of the minor is of paramount importance to the Court which stands in loco parentis to the minor. Of course, the wishes of the minor are to be given due weightage, and, in the instant case, the same has been done. 14. We, therefore, see no reason to interfere with the order passed by the learned Principal Judge, Family Court, Mumbai at Bandra, as affirmed by the Bombay High Court. 15. The Special Leave Petitions are, accordingly, dismissed and all interim orders are hereby dissolved."

GOPINATH PILLAI ...APPELLANT VERSUS STATE OF GUJARAT & ORS. ...RESPONDENTS JUDGMENT B. SUDERSHAN REDDY, J. Crl.M.P.No.19538/2009 for permission to file Special Leave Petition is allowed. 2. Leave granted in both the appeals. 3. These appeals are being disposed of by a common order since the same impugned order dated 09.09.2009 made in MCRLA No. 10625/2009 in SCRLA No.822/2004 of the High Court of Gujarat is under challenge in both the appeals. The High Court by the 2 impugned order granted stay of the report submitted by the learned Metropolitan Magistrate dated 07.09.2009 in Crime No.8/2004 registered with DCB Police Station, Ahmedabad. The impugned order is challenged by the appellants on various grounds. In order to consider the same it may be just and necessary to notice few relevant facts: 4. The appellant in Criminal Appeal @ S.L.P.(Crl.)No.7305/2009 is the mother of the deceased Israt Jehan who is alleged to have been killed by the Gujarat Police in an alleged encounter dated 15.06.2004. The appellant in Criminal Appeal @ Crl. M. P. No. 19538/2009 is the father of the deceased Javed Gulam Mohammed Sheikh @ Pranesh Kumar Pillai who is also alleged to have been killed by the Gujarat Police in a fake encounter. The appellants have been moving from pillar to post seeking justice and a proper inquiry into the matter. They have been consistently asserting before all the authorities that their children were the victims of a fake encounter staged in the year 2004 by the officers of the Gujarat Police. The appellant Shamima Kauser filed a Writ Petition under Article 226 of the Constitution of India, being Special Criminal Application No.822/2004, before the High Court of Ahmedabad, seeking an investigation into the death of her daughter, by the Central Bureau of Investigation, for the reason that she firmly believed that her daughter had been wrongfully done to death by the Gujarat Police in a fake encounter. The appellant in the other 3 appeal filed Writ Petition in this court seeking appropriate directions to order investigation by the Central Bureau of Investigation into the ""fake encounter killing"" of his son Javed Gulam Mohammed Sheikh @ Pranesh Kumar Pillai. The said Writ Petition was disposed of by this court granting liberty to the petitioner to approach the High Court of Gujarat seeking appropriate remedy since a Writ Petition arising out of a similar incident was already pending before the High Court. 5. On 07.08.2009 a leaned Single Judge of the High Court passed an order adjourning the Special Criminal Application No. 822/2004 filed by Shamima Kauser to explore the possibility of handing over the investigation to higher officer/s from the cadre of Additional Director General of Police. The material portion of the order reads as under: ""With a view to explore the possibility of handing over the investigation to higher officer/s. i.e. officer/s above the tank of Deputy Commissioner of Police, more particularly, from the cadre of Additional D.G., matter is adjourned to 12.08.2009. To be taken up at 1630 hours."" 6. On 13.08.2009, the learned Single Judge having considered the list of police officers produced by the State of Gujarat passed a detailed order constituting a Team of Investigation ""for the purpose of carrying out the investigation."" A team of three senior most officers was constituted for the aforesaid purpose. The High Court also granted permission to Shamima Kauser to make suggestions to the 4 Investigating Team with regard to areas of investigation and to inspect the record qua the FSL report and the ballistic report. The High Court further directed the Investigating Team to consider all the aspects from every angle relevant for the purpose of finding out whether the incident was a genuine encounter or a fake one. The report was directed to be placed before the court on the next date of hearing. The appellant promptly submitted an application before the Investigating Team for inspection of documents and a further application suggesting some areas of investigation. 7. On 07.09.2009, the Metropolitan Magistrate, Court No.1, Ahmedabad, having made an inquiry under Section 176 of the Criminal Procedure Code pursuant to the orders dated 12.08.2009 of the Chief Metropolitan Magistrate submitted an Inquiry Report in respect of death of (1) Israt Jehan, (2) Jishan Johar, (3)Amjad Ali Akbar Ali Rana@ Salim @ Raj Kumar and (4) Javed Ghulam Sheikh. The learned Magistrate having made a detailed analysis of the material available on record found that they were killed by ""the ------ police officers and police personnel with their service revolver and unlicenced and illegally held AK-56 rifle and with other weapons fired bullets on body of deceased and thereby murdered ---- in a systemic manner, cold-bloodedly, mercilessly and cruelly."" 5 8. On 09.09.2009, the State of Gujarat and as well as two police officers whose names were mentioned in the report filed Miscellaneous Applications in Special Criminal Application No.822/2004 with a prayer to set aside the report dated 07.09.2009 of the learned Magistrate whereunder the alleged encounters were found to be fake. The matter was orally mentioned for listing and they were taken up on the same day at about 4.30 p.m. by the learned Single Judge and disposed of by the impugned order. However, the Criminal Miscellaneous Applications filed by the individual police officers were withdrawn and only Miscellaneous Criminal Application No. 10625/2009 filed by the State of Gujarat was heard and disposed of. 9. The learned counsel for the appellant - Ms. Kaimini Jaiswal, and Mr. Huzefa Ahmadi appearing on behalf of the appellant in the other appeal expressed their serious objection to the manner in which the learned Single Judge took up the application filed by the State of Gujarat and granted stay of the report with a further direction to the Registrar General to make a detailed inquiry into the matter which led to holding a parallel inquiry and filing of the report by the learned Magistrate. The learned Judge was of the opinion that the inquiry made by the learned Magistrate was beyond ""the provision of law."" It was strenuously contended the very Miscellaneous 6 Application filed by the State of Gujarat in the Writ Petition filed by one of the appellants herein was not maintainable. 10. Notwithstanding various observations made by the Learned Single Judge in the impugned order the fact remains the order passed by the learned Single Jude is ad-interim in its nature granting stay of the operation of the report as at present. The learned Single Judge not yet finally disposed of the Criminal Miscellaneous Application filed by the State of Gujarat. The effect of the order passed by the learned Single Judge is that the operation of the report is kept in abeyance and therefore no further action based on the said report could be initiated in whatsoever manner. In such view of the matter we are not inclined to interfere with such ad-interim order in exercise of our jurisdiction under Article 136 of the Constitution of India. Interest of justice would be met if the main Writ Petition itself is heard and disposed of alongwith the Criminal Miscellaneous Application filed by the State of Gujarat. In the meanwhile, the Investigating Team already constituted by the High Court shall not deal with the report of the learned Magistrate in any manner whatsoever. However, the observations made in the impugned order with regard to the report of the learned Magistrate are set aside which are totally unnecessary. The observations so made if allowed to remain may result in far reaching consequences. We fail to appreciate as to why and what made the learned Judge to make such observations 7 even while the very application filed by the State is kept pending for its adjudication. The directions issued to the Registrar General to make a detailed inquiry into the matter which led to holding of inquiry by the Magistrate under Section 176 of the Code of Criminal Procedure is also set aside. 11. We must express our reservations the manner in which the proceedings went on before the High Court resulting in the impugned order. In the circumstances we consider it appropriate to request the learned Chief Justice of the High Court to place Special Miscellaneous Application No.822/2004 along with Criminal Miscellaneous Applications including Criminal Miscellaneous Application No. 10625/2009 filed by the State of Gujarat for their disposal in accordance with law as expeditiously as possible preferably within six months from today. It is needless to observe that the observations made in the impugned order shall have no bearing whatsoever upon the merits of the case. The Division Bench is required to adjudicate the Special Criminal Application on its own merits uninfluenced by the previous order passed by the learned Single Judge in the matter. It is also needless to observe that the Division Bench shall consider the very maintainability of the Criminal Miscellaneous Application filed by the State of Gujarat. 8 12. Impleadment Application in Criminal Appeal @ S.L.P.(Crl.)No.7305/2009 : In view of the final orders passed in the Criminal Appeals no further order is required to be passed in this application. The application shall accordingly stand dismissed with liberty granted to the applicant to avail such remedies as may be available in law. 13. The appeals are accordingly disposed of. ................................J. [B.SUDERSHAN REDDY] ................................J. [SURINDER SINGH NIJJAR] New Delhi, April 19, 2010"

Sudershan Reddy Bench: B. Sudershan Reddy , Surinder Singh Nijjar KILLICK NIXON LTD. v. THE CUSTODIAN AND ORS. (Civil Appeal No. 2724 of 2006) APRIL 27, 2010 [B. Sudershan Reddy and Surinder Singh Nijjar, JJ.] 2010 (5) SCR 275 The Judgment of the Court was delivered by B. SUDERSHAN REDDY, J. 1. These appeals are directed against the orders of interlocutory nature passed by the Special Court constituted under the provisions of the Special Courts (Trial of Offences Relating to Transactions in Securities) Act, 1992 (hereinafter referred to as `the Act'). They are being disposed of by this common order since the question that arises for our consideration is one and the same. 2. M/s. Dhanraj Mills Private Limited in its ordinary course of business had advanced interest free loans to the appellant M/s. Killick Nixon Limited and its group of companies. In the year 1992, the Special Court found that M/s. Dhanraj Mills Private Limited, its Directors and their close associates indulged in fraudulent securities transactions resulting in siphoning of huge funds of various banks. The banks had gone into liquidation as a result of those fraudulent securities transactions. The Special Court also held that the end beneficiaries of the siphoned funds were the Directors of M/s. Dhanraj Mills Private Limited and Director of Bank of Karad which bank was used as a conduit for the fraudulent transactions. 3. M/s. Dhanraj Mills Private Limited was accordingly notified under the provisions of the said Act. On and from the date of notification, the properties, movable or immovable, or both belonging to any person notified under sub-section (2) of Section 3 of the said Act shall stand attached, simultaneously with the issue of the notification. Be it noted that M/s. Dhanraj Mills Private Limited itself owned 33% of M/s. Killick Nixon Limited and the person in ultimate control, ownership and management of M/s. Killick Nixon Limited is one T.B. Ruia (who at all relevant points of time was Managing Director of M/s. Dhanraj Mills Private Limited) who was also notified under the Act. 4. The Custodian, on behalf of M/s Dhanraj Mills Private Limited, proceeded against the appellant M/s. Killick Nixon Ltd. and its group Companies for recovery of loans totaling Rs.20,81,67,031/-. The amounts due to M/s. Dhanraj Mills Private Limited also stood attached with the issue of notification. 5. In the year 1995, the appellant M/s. Killick Nixon Limited and its group Companies filed separate applications before Special Court for ascertaining their individual liabilities with a request to grant time for recompense. Simultaneously, the Custodian also filed applications for fixation of liability and demanding interest @ 24% per annum. In the year 1997, the Special Court passed decrees against the appellant and its group Companies which are consent decrees qua invitum the Custodian, whereby individually ascertained amounts were to be paid in installments with the interest @ 15% per annum. Similar consent decree was passed against 13th group Company also. 6. M/s Dhanraj Mills Private Limited, in the meanwhile, made an application before the Special Judge contending that the amounts recovered from the group Companies cannot be attached towards the debt payable by M/s Dhanraj Mills Private Limited to the Custodian, since there was no nexus between loans advanced to original judgment-debtors and the transactions with the banks. The prayer in the said application was that the amount so recovered was to be freed from attachment until to be paid back to M/s Dhanraj Mills Private Limited, by the Custodian. The Special Court dismissed the claim so made on the ground that the Directors of M/s Dhanraj Mills Private Limited and its close associates were involved in fraudulent deals and have siphoned off funds belonging to banks. The Special Court found overwhelming evidence that M/s Dhanraj Mills Private Limited is liable to make payment and all its assets fall within the purview of the Act. It is in this order the Special Court specifically held that this is a fit case ""for the corporate veil to be torn off"" as M/s Dhanraj Mills Private Limited had no explanation whatsoever for how such large amounts of ""loans"" could have been advanced to the appellant and its group Companies when M/s Dhanraj Mills Private Limited itself had been defunct for many years without any commercial activity of its own. 7. In the year 1999, The Special Court having considered the request of the original judgment debtors, granted extension of time and directed the Custodian not to proceed with execution of the decrees, subject to payment of defaulted installments. As usually, the appellant and its group Companies defaulted in payment of the said amounts once again. Left with no alternative, the Custodian filed execution applications against the judgment debtors for recovery of dues from M/s Dhanraj Mills Private Limited. It is not necessary to refer the facts, the subsequent events in detail and various objections raised from time to time as to the sale of properties in the process of realizing the decretal amounts. However, one important fact that may be required to state is that the Special Court by its earlier order dated 30th November, 2001 required the judgment debtors to pay Rs.16 crores payable towards all decrees for considering the prayer for extension of time to which all of them agreed to do so. This singular fact establishes that even judgment debtors were treating the separate decrees passed against each one of them as a consolidated common decree. The Custodian, at all points of time treated them as a group to which no objections were raised at any point of time. The sale proceeds were accordingly appropriated against dues of the entire group of M/s Killick Nixon Ltd. 8. The dispute now raised by the appellants is that the sale proceeds or the properties of M/s. Killick Nixon group companies ought to be apportioned individually decree wise. This is contrary to its earlier stand. The material available on record also reveals that these group companies have always referred to the aggregate principal amount of alleged loan given by M/s. Dhanraj Mills Private Limited. 9. The appellants submitted before the Special Court that the liabilities of the judgment debtors under separate decrees were not joint liabilities inasmuch as each judgment debtor is a separate entity in law having their separate properties and assets. It was the case of the appellants that merely because the judgment debtors are group companies the amount of decree passed against them cannot be consolidated. It was their case that the Custodian cannot be permitted to appropriate the amounts paid by the judgment debtors as also the sale proceeds realized from the sale of properties towards a consolidated decree. It is not necessary to refer in detail the stand taken by the Custodian opposing the plea of the appellants. Various instances were pointed out by the Custodian as to how the appellants themselves were treating the decrees as a consolidated one. 10. It was specifically demonstrated by the Custodian that the appellants not only treated them as one group but have themselves proceeded and agreed to have appropriation of the sale proceeds of the properties sold on group basis. The averment in the petition filed in the Special Court contained figures relating to the aggregate dues of the group, the aggregate amounts received from the sale of properties and the aggregate balance amount. 11. The Special Court after a detailed consideration came to the conclusion that M/s. Killick Nixon Limited and others are group companies and they are all controlled by M/s. Dhanraj Mills Private Limited - notified party and the amounts that are being recovered in execution of the decrees are really public funds which were siphoned off by the Directors of M/s Dhanraj Mills Private Limited, and parked in the companies controlled by them. The Special Court accordingly held that the appropriation of sale proceeds made by the Custodian is proper and accordingly the Custodian should proceed further to recover the amount that remained in balance. 12. In these appeals, the singular submission made by Shri Dhruv Mehta, learned senior counsel for the appellants, is that the appropriation of sale proceeds ought to have been carried out individually against each of the decree and not as done by the Custodian treating all the decrees as a consolidated decree. 13. Having heard learned counsel for the appellants and respondent, we are satisfied that an interference with the impugned order passed by the Special Court, which is purely interlocutory and does not decide any rights of any party, is unwarranted. The Special Court did not decide any rights of the parties but merely passed orders from time to time including the one under the appeals for the realization of the amounts under the decrees passed which attained their finality. The procedure adopted for realization of the amounts under the decrees and the manner of appropriation, in our considered opinion, by itself does not amount to deciding any lis as such between the parties. Under Section 10 of the Act that an appeal shall lie to this Court from any judgment, sentence or order of the Special Court but not against the interlocutory orders. Appeals against interlocutory orders are specially excluded under the said provision. 14. There cannot be any iota of doubt that M/s Killick Nixon and other companies were always treated as one group and there is a clear finding in this regard by the Special Court that the said group of companies are nothing but front companies of M/s. Dhanraj Mills Private Limited. 15. The orders impugned in these appeals are purely interlocutory in nature against which no appeal lies to this court under Section 10 of the Act. We are fortified in that view of ours by a decision of this court in CIFCO Properties (P) Ltd. and Others vs. Custodian and Others1 . Even on merits, we find that the Special Court having meticulously analyzed the facts, arrived at a proper conclusion and rightly treated the decrees as a consolidated one. 16. We find no merit in these appeals and they are accordingly dismissed without any order as to costs."
